# General Preferences

- User prefers code to follow SOLID and DRY principles and wants thorough code reviews with refactoring suggestions to improve code quality.
- User prefers direct implementation over extensive planning and analysis phases.
- User prefers local and GitHub histories to be kept in sync and wants commits pushed with any necessary fixes to satisfy GitHub push protection.
- Always double-check during testing or implementation if any changes have been lost or overwritten (e.g., after merges/sanitization), and verify via git
  diff/log before proceeding.
