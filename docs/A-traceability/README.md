## Traceability Matrix Structure

### Requirements to Implementation

- **Functional Requirements**: Mapped to code components and modules
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Mapped to architecture decisions and quality measures
- **Use Cases**: Mapped to user interface flows and API endpoints
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Mapped to automated test cases

### Requirements to Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Coverage of individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Verification of component interactions
- **Acceptance Tests**: Validation of user scenarios and requirements
- **Performance Tests**: Verification of non-functional requirements
- **Security Tests**: Validation of security controls and measures

### Requirements to Compliance

- **Regulatory Standards**: Mapping to specific regulation requirements
- **Industry Standards**: Alignment with best practices and frameworks
- **Quality Standards**: Compliance with quality models and metrics
- **Security Standards**: Implementation of security controls and measures

## Compliance Status Overview

### Current Compliance Status

- **GDPR**: 85% compliant (privacy controls implemented)
- **OWASP ASVS v4.0**: 75% compliant (security controls in progress)
- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: 60% compliant (accessibility features planned)
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148**: 90% compliant (requirements processes established)
- **ISO/IEC 25010:2023**: 70% compliant (quality measures in development)

### Compliance Gaps and Actions

1. **Accessibility**: Complete WCAG 2.2 AA implementation
2. **Security**: Finalize ASVS v4.0 control implementation
3. **Quality**: Implement remaining quality model measures
4. **Documentation**: Complete compliance artifact documentation

## Audit and Verification

### Audit Trail

- **Requirements Changes**: Tracked through version control and change management
- **Implementation Changes**: Linked to requirements through traceability matrix
- **Test Results**: Mapped to requirements and compliance standards
- **Compliance Reviews**: Regular assessment of compliance status

### Verification Methods

- **Requirements Review**: Stakeholder validation of requirements completeness
- **Design Review**: Architecture alignment with requirements and standards
- **Code Review**: Implementation compliance with coding standards
- **Test Review**: Test coverage and compliance verification
- **Compliance Audit**: External assessment of regulatory compliance

## Continuous Compliance

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly compliance status reviews
- **Gap Analysis**: Identification and remediation of compliance gaps
- **Standard Updates**: Tracking and implementation of standard updates
- **Training**: Team training on compliance requirements and procedures

### Compliance Integration

- **Development Process**: Compliance checks integrated into development workflow
- **Testing Process**: Compliance verification included in test procedures
- **Release Process**: Compliance validation required for releases
- **Change Management**: Compliance impact assessment for changes
