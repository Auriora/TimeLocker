# WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance Checklist

This document tracks compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at the AA level, as required by the project's accessibility requirements.

## Overview

The BackupManager application must comply with WCAG 2.2 AA standards to ensure accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities. This checklist tracks our compliance status for each relevant success criterion.

## Success Criteria Checklist

### 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) - Level AA

**Requirement**: When a user interface component receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Approach**:
- Ensure that no popups, tooltips, or other UI elements obscure focused elements
- Implement focus management that keeps focused elements visible
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

**Evidence**: 
- Screenshots showing focus states
- Automated accessibility test results
- Manual testing documentation

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)" (NFR-ACC-01)

### 2.5.7 Dragging Movements Alternative - Level AA

**Requirement**: All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential.

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Approach**:
- Provide button alternatives for all drag operations
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for drag operations
- Ensure all drag interactions have non-drag alternatives

**Evidence**:
- UI design documentation showing alternatives
- Implementation code review notes
- User testing results

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Dragging Movements Alternative" (NFR-ACC-03)

---

### 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) - Level AA

**Requirement**: The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels.

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Approach**:
- Design system enforces minimum 24×24px clickable areas
- UI component library with standardized touch targets
- Automated testing for minimum target sizes

**Evidence**:
- Design system documentation
- Component measurements
- Accessibility audit results

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 design-system rule "24 × 24 px targets" (NFR-ACC-04)

---

### 3.2.6 Consistent Help - Level A

**Requirement**: Help mechanisms (like contact information, help links, or support tools) are presented consistently across the application.

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Approach**:
- Consistent help button location across all screens
- Standardized help documentation format
- Consistent support contact information

**Evidence**:
- UI screenshots showing help mechanisms
- Help system documentation
- User feedback on help accessibility

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Consistent Help" (NFR-ACC-05)

---

### 3.3.7 Redundant Entry - Level A

**Requirement**: Information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the same process is either auto-populated or available for the user to select.

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Approach**:
- Form state persistence across sessions
- Auto-fill for previously entered information
- User profile data reuse across forms

**Evidence**:
- Form implementation documentation
- User flow diagrams showing data reuse
- Test cases for form data persistence

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Redundant Entry" (NFR-ACC-06)

---

### 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) - Level AA

**Requirement**: Authentication processes that rely on cognitive function tests provide at least one alternative method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Approach**:
- Multiple authentication options (password, biometric, token)
- Simple, clear authentication flows
- Accessible CAPTCHA alternatives

**Evidence**:
- Authentication flow documentation
- Accessibility test results for login processes
- User testing with assistive technologies

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Accessible Authentication (Minimum)" (NFR-ACC-06)

---

## Aspirational AAA Criteria

While not required for AA compliance, the following AAA criteria are being tracked as aspirational goals:

### 2.4.13 Focus Appearance - Level AAA

**Status**: Aspirational

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Focus Appearance (AAA)" (NFR-ACC-02)

### 3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced) - Level AAA

**Status**: Aspirational

**SRS Reference**: § 3.4.9 bullet "Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)" (NFR-ACC-06)

## Testing and Validation

This checklist will be updated with evidence screenshots and test results as implementation progresses. Regular accessibility audits will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
