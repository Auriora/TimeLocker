- **Historical Analysis:** Complete operation history for analysis

### Configuration Integration

- **Service Configuration:** All services use centralized configuration
- **Dynamic Updates:** Configuration changes are applied immediately
- **Validation:** All configuration values are validated before use
- **Persistence:** Configuration survives service restarts

### Notification Integration

- **Status Notifications:** Automatic notifications for operation completion
- **Security Alerts:** Critical security events trigger immediate notifications
- **Configurable Thresholds:** User-configurable notification triggers
- **Multi-Channel:** Support for multiple notification channels simultaneously

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests

- **Security Service:** 15 comprehensive test cases covering all security functionality
- **Status Reporter:** 18 test cases covering operation tracking and reporting
- **Notification Service:** 12 test cases covering all notification channels
- **Configuration Manager:** 16 test cases covering configuration management
- **Integration Service:** 10 test cases covering component integration

### Integration Tests

- **End-to-End Workflows:** 12 comprehensive workflow tests
- **Error Handling:** Tests for graceful error recovery
- **Concurrent Operations:** Tests for multiple simultaneous operations
- **Security Scenarios:** Tests for security breach detection and response
- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Tests for configuration-based operation

### Test Coverage

- **Security Components:** 100% coverage of critical security paths
- **Integration Scenarios:** Complete workflow testing from start to finish
- **Error Conditions:** Comprehensive error handling and recovery testing
- **Cross-Component Integration:** Testing of all component interactions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration Usage

```python
from TimeLocker import IntegrationService, CredentialManager

# Initialize integrated service
integration_service = IntegrationService()

# Setup security
credential_manager = CredentialManager()
credential_manager.unlock("master_password")
integration_service.initialize_security(credential_manager)

# Execute integrated backup
result = integration_service.execute_backup(repository, backup_target)
```

### Configuration Management

```python
from TimeLocker.config import ConfigurationModule

config_module = ConfigurationModule()

# Configure notifications
config_module.update_section("notifications", {
    "desktop_enabled": True,
    "email_enabled": True,
    "email_to": ["admin@example.com"]
})
```

### Security Monitoring

```python
from TimeLocker.security import SecurityService

security_service = SecurityService(credential_manager)

# Verify repository encryption
encryption_status = security_service.verify_repository_encryption(repository)

# Get security summary
summary = security_service.get_security_summary(days=7)
```
