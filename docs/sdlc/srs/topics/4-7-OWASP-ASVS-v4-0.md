# 4.7 OWASP ASVS v4.0 – How It Helps

| How ASVS v4.0 helps                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Practical effect on this project                                                                                                                                       |

| **Scope & maturity levels (L1–L3)** – The standard defines three assurance levels. For a consumer‑facing backup tool that stores sensitive personal data, we’re aiming at **Level 2** (authenticated‑user security). | Sets the minimum bar for encryption, auth, session handling, logging, and configuration hardening we must meet.                                                        |
| **Concrete control catalog** – 14 sections (V1‑V14) cover everything from architecture to cryptography and logging.                                                                                                  | We can trace many FR‑SEC and FR‑MON items directly to ASVS controls (e.g., V6‑Stored Cryptography → AES‑256 requirement; V11‑Business Logic → hash‑chained audit log). |
| **Design‑time guidance** – ASVS is not just a test checklist; it tells architects what to build in from the start.                                                                                                   | Influenced the decision to use OS key‑rings (V2‑Authentication Storage) and to default‑deny network egress except to user‑configured endpoints (V4‑Access Control).    |
| **Test & audit readiness** – Pen‑testers and auditors often test against ASVS. Having it in the SRS signals that we’ll supply evidence mapped to those controls.                                                     | The **docs/compliance/** folder will include an “ASVS traceability matrix” showing how each control is satisfied or why it’s not applicable.                           |
| **Community & longevity** – Maintained by OWASP with regular updates; aligns with other standards like ISO 27001 and NIST 800‑53.                                                                                    | Gives us a living baseline so the app can keep pace with evolving threats without reinventing criteria each release.                                                   |
