# 1.5 Overview

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive and structured description of the **TimeLocker**, including its functional and non-functional requirements. The document is designed to serve as a key reference point for all stakeholders—developers, quality assurance engineers, project managers, UX/UI designers, security teams, and other contributors—throughout the software development lifecycle.
The primary objective of this SRS is to not only specify what the application is meant to accomplish but also define the scope, constraints, and quality criteria that govern its development. By addressing both the "what" and "how" of the application's functionality, this document ensures all stakeholders maintain alignment on the project's goals, guiding development efforts and confirming compliance with industry-best practices such as GDPR, OWASP-ASVS, and ISO/IEEE standards.
To facilitate easy navigation and clear understanding, the SRS is divided into the following sections:
1. **Introduction (Section 1):** Outlines the purpose, intended audience, and scope of the TimeLocker application. This section also establishes clarity and alignment by defining key terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used throughout the document.
2. **Overall Description (Section 2):** Provides a high-level perspective of the application, including its architectural context, targeted user base, assumptions, dependencies, and any known constraints that could impact development or operation.
3. **Specific Requirements (Section 3):** The core of the document, this section details both functional and non-functional requirements:
    - **Functional Requirements:** Organized into logical categories such as repository management, backup operations, recovery operations, policy management, and monitoring/reporting. These requirements outline critical features like snapshot creation, retention policy updates, and disaster recovery processes.
    - **Non-functional Requirements:** Specifies performance, reliability, usability, accessibility, scalability, security, and auditability criteria to ensure the application meets operational expectations and complies with defined standards.

4. **Use Cases (Section 3.5):** Links the requirements to real-world scenarios, describing the workflow and actors involved (e.g., everyday users, power users, and system operations). Each use case highlights specific goals such as configuring repositories, scheduling backups, and verifying audit logs.
5. **References and Compliance (Section 4):** This section integrates supporting materials and references to align the application's design and functionality with established regulatory frameworks and standards, ensuring adherence to guidelines such as GDPR and OWASP.

Additionally, appendices further supplement the document with glossaries, analysis models, and compliance documentation artifacts to aid in deeper understanding and auditability.
