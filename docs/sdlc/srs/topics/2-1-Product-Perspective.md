# 2.1 Product Perspective
The TimeLocker is a standalone desktop client that wraps the Restic CLI and augments it with a modern GUI, scheduling, policy enforcement, and reporting. It interacts with:

- **Local system resources** (file system, OS scheduler, key‑ring/credential store).
- **Remote storage services** (S3, SFTP, SMB, NFS, etc.).
- **Third‑party automation tools** via a JSON‑RPC/REST API. 2.1 Product Perspective
