### Scope

The TimeLocker is intended to improve user backup workflows by supporting personal desktops, with **Linux** as the primary target platform. Future releases will extend support to **Windows** and **macOS**. By leveraging **Restic**, TimeLocker offers:
- Comprehensive backup options: full, partial, and incremental.
- Scheduling and event-driven retention mechanisms.
- High data security, including encryption and auditing.
- Reliable support for a wide range of storage backends, such as local disks and cloud services like **SFTP**, **SMB**, and **S3**.

TimeLocker is **not** intended to replace enterprise server-based solutions or OS-level backup tools. Instead, it complements existing personal and small-scale backup workflows, providing an independent, flexible option.
