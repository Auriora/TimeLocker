# 1  Introduction

The **Desktop Backup Application (DBA)** is designed to provide an accessible, intuitive, and secure solution for managing file-system backups. By enhancing the functionality of the open-source **Restic CLI** with a graphical user interface and additional capabilities, DBA simplifies complex backup and restoration tasks. This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) serves as a comprehensive reference, defining the functional and non-functional requirements of the application. It aims to ensure alignment and clarity across all stakeholders, including developers, project managers, UX designers, and quality assurance teams.

Targeting Linux desktop environments as its initial focus, DBA also plans to support **Windows** and **macOS** systems in later stages. The application's core objective is to provide a seamless user experience for both technical and non-technical users while meeting modern standards for data security, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and usability. With features such as scheduled backups, policy enforcement, encryption, and reporting, DBA accommodates a wide range of use cases, from personal backups to small business disaster recovery planning.

By combining a user-friendly design with powerful automation and integration capabilities, DBA fills a critical gap in the market—allowing users to achieve effective backup management without requiring familiarity with complex command-line tools. Through this SRS, stakeholders are equipped with the guidance needed for the development lifecycle, ensuring the successful delivery of a robust, scalable, and reliable backup application.
