## About The Product

The **TimeLocker** is designed to provide an accessible, intuitive, and secure solution for managing file-system backups. By enhancing the functionality of the open-source **Restic CLI** with a graphical user interface and additional capabilities, TimeLocker simplifies complex backup and restoration tasks. 

Targeting Linux desktop environments as its initial focus, TimeLocker also plans to support **Windows** and **macOS** systems in later stages. The application's core objective is to provide a seamless user experience for both technical and non-technical users while meeting modern standards for data security, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and usability. With features such as scheduled backups, policy enforcement, encryption, and reporting, TimeLocker accommodates a wide range of use cases, from personal backups to small business disaster recovery planning.

By combining a user-friendly design with powerful automation and integration capabilities, TimeLocker fills a critical gap in the marketâ€”allowing users to achieve effective backup management without requiring familiarity with complex command-line tools. Through this SRS, stakeholders are equipped with the guidance needed for the development lifecycle, ensuring the successful delivery of a robust, scalable, and reliable backup application.
