| **Stakeholders & Interests** | **Power User** – wants to verify the integrity of audit logs to ensure they haven't been tampered with. <br> **System** – must provide reliable verification mechanisms to maintain trust and compliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Pre-conditions**           | 1. User has appropriate permissions to access audit logs. <br> 2. Audit logs exist in the system. <br> 3. System has been configured to maintain tamper-evident logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Post-conditions**          | • Successful: Audit log integrity verified; verification result displayed to user; verification event recorded. <br> • Failure: Integrity verification fails; user notified of potential tampering; security alert generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Main Flow**                | 1. User navigates to **Monitoring** > **Audit Logs** section. <br> 2. User selects **Verify Integrity** option. <br> 3. System displays available audit log files with date ranges. <br> 4. User selects specific log file or date range to verify. <br> 5. System executes `audit verify` command on selected logs. <br> 6. System checks cryptographic signatures and hash chains in the logs. <br> 7. System compares current hashes with previously stored values. <br> 8. System displays verification results with details (timestamp, verification method, result). <br> 9. System records verification attempt in the audit log. <br> 10. User reviews verification results and acknowledges. |
| **Alternative Flows**        | **AF-1 Tamper detected** <br> a. System detects hash mismatch or broken signature chain. <br> b. System displays detailed information about the specific tampering location and type. <br> c. System generates security alert and logs the event. <br> d. System provides options for investigation and remediation. <br><br> **AF-2 Verification error** <br> a. System encounters error during verification process. <br> b. System logs error details and notifies user. <br> c. System offers troubleshooting options. <br><br> **AF-3 Missing verification data** <br> a. System cannot find baseline hashes or signatures for comparison. <br> b. System notifies user that verification is inconclusive and explains why.                                                      |
| **Special Requirements**     | • Verification must complete within 2 seconds for logs up to 10 MB (NFR-AUD-02). <br> • System must use cryptographically secure methods for verification. <br> • Verification results must include detailed information about the verification process. <br> • System must maintain separate verification metadata to detect log substitution attacks. <br> • Verification must work offline without requiring external services.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
