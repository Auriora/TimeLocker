# 2  Overall Description

This section provides a high-level summary of the **TimeLocker**, describing its purpose, functionality, and interactions with its environment. The TimeLocker is a standalone desktop application designed to simplify complex backup and recovery tasks by building on the capabilities of the **Restic CLI**. By integrating Restic's powerful, command-line-driven functionality with a streamlined graphical user interface, TimeLocker makes managing backups intuitive and accessible for both technical and non-technical users.
The application serves as a bridge between advanced backup features and user-centric design, addressing the challenges users face when managing manual file-system backups. With features like automated scheduling, retention policy enforcement, encryption, and monitoring, the TimeLocker ensures a reliable, secure, and seamless backup experience while enabling disaster recovery solutions for personal and small business purposes.
TimeLocker operates within diverse backup environments, interacting with local file systems, external network storage services (e.g. S3, SFTP, SMB), and integrated tools via APIs. It supports both personal file systems and cloud-based repositories, providing flexibility for users to secure and recover their data no matter the storage medium. Additionally, it includes safeguards such as encryption, data integrity checks, and GDPR-compliant features like personal metadata export and erasure.
