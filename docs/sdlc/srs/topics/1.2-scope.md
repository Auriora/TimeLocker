# 1.2 Scope
The DBA is a cross‑platform desktop application (initially Linux, with Windows and macOS support on the roadmap) that provides an intuitive interface for configuring, executing, monitoring, and restoring file‑system backups. The product **will**:

- Support multiple repository/storage back‑ends (local disk, external drive, SFTP, S3‑compatible object storage, network shares, etc.).
- Offer full, incremental, and scheduled backup operations using Restic as the core engine.
- Provide point‑in‑time and partial restore capabilities.
- Enforce backup policies (retention, frequency, prioritisation, life‑cycle).
- Implement encryption, and audit logging.

The product **will not**:

- Provide enterprise‑level centralised backup server functionality (future work).
- Replace native OS file‑history or snapshotting tools.
