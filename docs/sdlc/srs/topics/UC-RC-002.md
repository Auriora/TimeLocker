| **Stakeholders & Interests** | **Power User** – wants to restore a complete system after hardware failure or catastrophic data loss. <br> **System** – must provide reliable and complete restoration of all system components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Pre-conditions**           | 1. At least one complete system backup exists in a reachable repository. <br> 2. User has a bootable recovery media with the Desktop Backup Application. <br> 3. Target system has sufficient hardware resources to restore the backup. <br> 4. User has necessary credentials to access the repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Post-conditions**          | • Successful: Complete system restored to functional state; audit log `DISASTER_RECOVERY_SUCCESS` recorded. <br> • Failure: System not fully restored; error logged; user notified of specific components that failed to restore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Main Flow**                | 1. User boots from recovery media and launches the Desktop Backup Application in recovery mode. <br> 2. User selects repository containing system backup. <br> 3. System authenticates and connects to repository. <br> 4. System displays available system snapshots with dates and descriptions. <br> 5. User selects snapshot for full system recovery. <br> 6. System analyzes target hardware for compatibility. <br> 7. User confirms target partitions and boot configuration. <br> 8. System executes full system restore with progress indicators. <br> 9. Upon completion, system verifies critical system files. <br> 10. System writes `DISASTER_RECOVERY_SUCCESS` to audit log. <br> 11. System prompts for reboot to complete recovery. |
| **Alternative Flows**        | **AF-1 Hardware incompatibility** <br> a. System detects incompatible hardware. <br> b. System warns user and offers options to continue with potential issues or abort. <br><br> **AF-2 Insufficient disk space** <br> a. Target disk lacks space for complete restore. <br> b. System offers options to select different partitions or abort. <br><br> **AF-3 Authentication failure** <br> a. User cannot authenticate to repository. <br> b. System prompts for alternative credentials or repository. <br><br> **AF-4 Partial restore failure** <br> a. Some components fail to restore. <br> b. System logs specific failures, completes what it can, and provides detailed report.                                                      |
| **Special Requirements**     | • Recovery media must be bootable on UEFI and legacy BIOS systems. <br> • System must handle driver differences between source and target hardware. <br> • Progress updates must continue even during lengthy operations. <br> • Recovery process must be resumable after interruption when possible. <br> • System must provide detailed logs of all recovery actions for troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
