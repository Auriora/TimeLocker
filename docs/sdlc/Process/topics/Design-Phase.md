# 3. Design Phase

- **Objective:**
  Develop a technical design that integrates system architecture with the approved UX/UI designs.

- **Activities:**
  - Establish the high-level architecture with UML diagrams, including integration of UI elements with backend components.
  - Draft detailed design documentation outlining module designs, interfaces, database schemas, and how approved UI components are to be implemented.
  - Review design constraints, safety/security requirements, and external interface details as referenced in the SRS.

- **Documentation Produced:**
  - Architecture Design Document (with UML/Flow diagrams).
  - Detailed Design Specification Document (module descriptions, interface definitions, and integration details).

- **Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompt:**
  - **Prompt for Design Documents:**
```
Hi Junie, please produce the Architecture Design Document and Detailed Design Specification that combine our system's technical design with the approved UX and UI designs. Ensure that the document references the relevant sections of the SRS (including interfaces, security, and usability requirements). Once complete, share these documents for my review.
