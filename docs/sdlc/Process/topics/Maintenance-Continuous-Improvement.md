## Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

### Prompt for Maintenance Reviews
```
Hi Junie, please compile the most recent Maintenance Log and Post-Deployment Review Report, highlighting any issues observed and enhancements planned. Include performance metrics, security update status, and user feedback analysis. Identify any technical debt that needs addressing and recommend prioritization for upcoming maintenance activities. Share these documents for my periodic review to ensure the application remains aligned with its performance, security, and usability goals.
```

### Prompt for Performance Optimization
```
Hi Junie, please analyze our application's performance metrics over the past three months. Identify any trends, bottlenecks, or areas for optimization. Compare current performance against our established baselines and requirements. Recommend specific optimization strategies with expected impact assessments. Include code-level recommendations where applicable. Once complete, share your analysis and recommendations for my review.
```

### Prompt for Security Assessment
```
Hi Junie, please conduct a security assessment of our application, focusing on any new vulnerabilities or threats that have emerged since our last review. Evaluate our current security patch status, identify any outstanding security updates needed, and assess our compliance with OWASP ASVS requirements. Recommend prioritized security improvements with implementation approaches. Once complete, share your assessment for my review.
```

### Prompt for Continuous Improvement Plan
```
Hi Junie, please develop a Continuous Improvement Plan for the next quarter based on our maintenance logs, user feedback, and performance metrics.
