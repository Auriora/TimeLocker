# Traceability Mechanisms
- Establish traceability mechanisms between requirements, LLM prompts, and resulting design elements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 7.1)
- Create traceability matrices linking requirements to prompts to design artifacts
- Document relationships between design elements
- Verify complete requirements coverage
