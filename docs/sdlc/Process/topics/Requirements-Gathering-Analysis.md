# 1. Requirements Gathering & Analysis

- **Objective:**
  Ensure that all requirements—including those specific for a Desktop GUI—are clearly understood and agreed upon. The SRS document in docs/sdlc/SRS/ is the foundation, so its content (e.g., traceability matrices, external interface definitions, usability and security requirements) will be referenced throughout this process.

- **Activities:**
  - Review and confirm requirements provided in the existing SRS.
  - Identify additional requirements relevant to UX/UI and Desktop GUI functionality.
  - Update or add user stories and acceptance criteria as needed.

- **Documentation Produced:**
  - Requirements Confirmation Document (with annotations linking back to the SRS).
  - Updated user stories and acceptance criteria (if applicable).

- **Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompt:**
  - **Prompt for Requirements Confirmation Document:**
```
Hi Junie, please generate a Requirements Confirmation Document that summarizes the key functional and non-functional requirements from the SRS (located in docs/sdlc/SRS/). Ensure that it covers requirements for external interfaces, security, usability, and performance. Once done, please share the document for review and feedback.
