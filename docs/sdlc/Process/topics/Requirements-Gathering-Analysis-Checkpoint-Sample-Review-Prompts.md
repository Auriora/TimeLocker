# Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

## Prompt for Requirements Elicitation
```
Hi Junie, please create a Requirements Elicitation Plan for our Desktop GUI application. Include stakeholder interview questions, workshop agendas, and survey templates. Ensure the plan covers all aspects of the application as outlined in the SRS, with particular focus on usability, performance, and security requirements. Once complete, share the plan for my review before we begin the elicitation process.
```

## Prompt for Requirements Confirmation Document
```
Hi Junie, please generate a Requirements Confirmation Document that summarizes the key functional and non-functional requirements from the SRS (located in docs/sdlc/SRS/). Ensure that it covers requirements for external interfaces, security, usability, and performance. Include traceability information and highlight any assumptions or constraints. Verify that all requirements meet quality criteria (clear, complete, consistent, verifiable). Once done, please share the document for review and feedback.
```

## Prompt for Requirements Prioritization
```
Hi Junie, please analyze the requirements we've gathered and create a prioritization matrix using the MoSCoW method. Consider business value, implementation effort, dependencies, and risks in your analysis. Provide rationale for each prioritization decision. Once complete, share the prioritization matrix for stakeholder review and approval.
```

## Prompt for Requirements Traceability
```
Hi Junie, please create a Requirements Traceability Matrix that links each requirement in the SRS to its source, related design elements, implementation components, and test cases. Identify any requirements that lack complete traceability and recommend actions to address these gaps. Once complete, share the traceability matrix for my review.
