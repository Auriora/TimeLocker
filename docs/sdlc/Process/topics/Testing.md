## Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

### Prompt for Test Strategy and Plan
```
Hi Junie, please create a comprehensive Test Strategy and Test Plan for our application. Include test coverage criteria, environment specifications, and approaches for all testing levels (unit, integration, system, UAT). Define specific strategies for security, performance, and accessibility testing. Ensure traceability to requirements in the SRS. Once complete, share these documents for my review before test execution begins.
```

### Prompt for Testing Deliverables
```
Hi Junie, please compile the Test Plan and associated Test Case Documents, including reports from our unit, integration, and system tests. Include test coverage metrics, performance test results, and security test findings. Also, share the UAT feedback documentation so I can review the overall test coverage and user feedback. Highlight any critical issues, their severity, and proposed resolution approaches. Provide recommendations for test process improvements based on the results.
```

### Prompt for Security Testing
```
Hi Junie, please conduct a comprehensive security assessment of our application. Evaluate against OWASP ASVS v4.0 requirements and our security requirements in the SRS. Include vulnerability scanning, authentication testing, and data protection validation. Document any findings with severity ratings and recommended mitigations. Once complete, share the security test report for my review.
```

### Prompt for Performance Testing
```
Hi Junie, please design and execute performance tests for our application. Focus on the key performance requirements specified in the SRS, particularly response time, throughput, and resource utilization under various load conditions. Include baseline measurements, test scenarios, and detailed results. Identify any performance bottlenecks and recommend optimization strategies. Share the complete performance test report for my review.
