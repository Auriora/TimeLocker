# Additional Considerations

- **Cross-Referencing the SRS:**
  Throughout the process, ensure that key deliverables (especially design and testing artifacts) reference the original SRS located in docs/sdlc/SRS/. This includes traceability matrices, usability criteria, security controls, and other specifics detailed in the SRS.

- **Using AI LLM (Junie) Effectively:**
  The provided sample prompts are designed to help you initiate review sessions with Junie and obtain detailed, context-specific documentation. Adjust the prompts as needed based on evolving project needs or feedback.

By embedding these review checkpoints and sample AI LLM chat prompts into the SDLC, the process mirrors how a full-fledged software development team would workâ€”ensuring thorough documentation, rigorous validations, and iterative approvals at every stage. Please let me know if you need any more adjustments or additional details in any phase!
