# Requirements Traceability
- Establish traceability between requirements and design elements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 7.1; IEEE 830-1998 Section 2.1.7)
- Create traceability matrices linking requirements to design components
- Ensure all requirements are addressed in the design
- Verify that design elements do not introduce functionality not specified in requirements
