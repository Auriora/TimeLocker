# Code-Requirements Traceability
- Establish traceability between code and requirements/design (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 7.1)
- Link code modules to design components
- Document how code implements specific requirements
- Verify complete requirements coverage in implementation
- Update traceability as code evolves
