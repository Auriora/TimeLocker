## Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

### Prompt for Deployment Plan
```
Hi Junie, please create a comprehensive Deployment Plan for our application. Include deployment prerequisites, sequence of activities, resource requirements, and timing. Detail the automated deployment procedures, security validation steps, and data migration approach. Document rollback procedures and contingency measures for potential issues. Ensure the plan addresses compliance requirements and includes a communication strategy for all stakeholders. Once complete, present this plan for my review before proceeding with staging deployment.
```

### Prompt for Deployment Documents
```
Hi Junie, please generate the Deployment Plan along with staging environment test reports. Ensure the documentation includes rollback procedures, performance validation results, and security verification findings. Include the production environment configuration documentation and post-deployment monitoring plan. Verify that all compliance requirements have been addressed and documented. Once complete, present these documents for my final review and sign-off on the production deployment.
```

### Prompt for User Documentation
```
Hi Junie, please create comprehensive user documentation for our application. Include user guides, training materials, and support procedures. Ensure the documentation is clear, accessible, and covers all key functionality. Include screenshots, step-by-step instructions, and troubleshooting guidance. Once complete, share these materials for review before finalizing for distribution to users.
```

### Prompt for Deployment Verification
```
Hi Junie, please design a deployment verification and validation plan for our application. Include specific tests to verify that the deployment was successful, that all components are functioning correctly, and that performance meets our requirements. Define the criteria for deployment success and procedures for addressing any issues discovered during verification. Once complete, share this plan for my review before the staging deployment.
