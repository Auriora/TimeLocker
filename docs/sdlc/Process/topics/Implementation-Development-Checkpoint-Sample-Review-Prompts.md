# Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

## Prompt for Code Review
```
Hi Junie, please prepare a summary of the recent code commits related to the UI integration and key features. Include commentary on how the design documents have been followed, how security best practices have been implemented, and how the code aligns with our coding standards. Analyze the code for maintainability, performance, and error handling. Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. Share this summary and associated code documentation so I can review and ensure everything is aligned with our approved plans.
```

## Prompt for Security Review
```
Hi Junie, please conduct a security review of our implementation, focusing on the authentication, data handling, and external interface components. Evaluate the code against OWASP ASVS v4.0 requirements and our security requirements in the SRS. Identify any potential vulnerabilities, recommend mitigations, and suggest improvements to our secure coding practices. Once complete, share your findings for my review.
```

## Prompt for Performance Analysis
```
Hi Junie, please analyze the performance of our application, particularly focusing on the data processing and UI rendering components. Identify any performance bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, or resource-intensive operations. Compare the current performance against our non-functional requirements in the SRS. Recommend optimization strategies and provide examples of how to implement them. Share your analysis for my review.
```

## Prompt for Documentation Review
```
Hi Junie, please review our code documentation for completeness and clarity. Ensure that all public APIs are well-documented, complex algorithms have explanatory comments, and code-to-requirements traceability is maintained. Identify any documentation gaps or inconsistencies. Generate updated API documentation based on the current codebase. Once complete, share your review and the updated documentation for my approval.
