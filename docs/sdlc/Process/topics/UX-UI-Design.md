# 2. UX & UI Design

## Objective
Define the user experience flows and visual presentation of the Desktop GUI application, ensuring usability, accessibility, and alignment with user needs and expectations.

## Activities

### User Research Methods
- Conduct user interviews to understand user needs and expectations (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 6.3.1; ISO 9241-210:2019 Section 6.2)
- Implement surveys to gather quantitative data on user preferences
- Create user personas to represent different user types
- Develop user scenarios to understand context of use

### UX Design
- Develop and review user journeys and interaction flows
- Create wireframes or low-fidelity prototypes
- Map user tasks to interface elements
- Design information architecture and navigation structures

### UI Design
- Produce high-fidelity mockups for primary screens
- Develop a UI style guide addressing visual elements, themes, colors, typography, and iconography
- Create component libraries for consistent implementation
- Design responsive layouts for different screen sizes

### Usability Testing Techniques and Metrics
- Conduct usability testing with representative users (IEEE 830-1998 Section 3.4; ISO 9241-210:2019 Section 8.3)
- Define usability metrics (task completion time, error rates, satisfaction scores)
- Implement A/B testing for alternative design solutions
- Document usability test results and recommendations

### Accessibility Considerations and Standards
- Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.2 guidelines (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 5.2.8; EN 301 549 v4.1.1)
- Design for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Implement proper color contrast and text sizing
- Provide alternatives for non-text content

### User Feedback Collection and Incorporation
- Establish methods for collecting user feedback (ISO 9241-210:2019 Section 6.3)
- Create feedback loops during design iterations
- Document and prioritize user feedback
- Implement changes based on user feedback

### Design Validation Against Requirements
- Verify design solutions against functional requirements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 6.4; IEEE 830-1998 Section 3.3.3)
- Validate designs against non-functional requirements
- Ensure traceability between requirements and design elements
- Document validation results and any discrepancies

### Design Iterations Based on User Feedback
- Implement iterative design process (ISO 9241-210:2019 Section 6.4)
- Define criteria for design refinement
- Document design changes between iterations
- Validate improvements through user testing

### Design Patterns and Best Practices
- Apply established design patterns for common interactions (ISO/IEC 25010:2023 Section 4.2)
- Follow platform-specific guidelines and conventions
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use consistent interaction patterns throughout the application

### Design Documentation Standards
- Create comprehensive design documentation (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Section 5.2.6)
- Document design decisions and rationales
- Maintain version control for design artifacts
- Ensure documentation is accessible to all team members

### Human-System Integration Process
- Integrate human factors considerations into system design (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Section 6.4.6)
- Design for optimal cognitive load and mental models
- Consider physical ergonomics for desktop application use
- Ensure appropriate feedback mechanisms for user actions

### Architectural Design Process for User Interfaces
- Align UI architecture with system architecture (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Section 6.4.4)
- Define UI component hierarchy and relationships
- Document UI state management approach
- Specify UI integration points with backend systems

### Human Factors Engineering Principles
- Apply cognitive psychology principles to interface design (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Section 6.4.6)
- Design for attention, perception, and memory limitations
- Implement error prevention and recovery mechanisms
- Consider cultural and contextual factors in design decisions

## Documentation Produced
- User Research Report (personas, scenarios, interview findings)
- UX Documentation (user journey maps, wireframes, and usability prototypes)
- UI Documentation (high-fidelity mockups and a detailed UI style guide)
- Usability Test Reports (findings, metrics, and recommendations)
- Accessibility Compliance Documentation
- Design System Documentation (component library, patterns, guidelines)
- Design Validation Report (traceability to requirements)
- Design Iteration History (changes based on feedback)

## Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

### For User Research
```
Hi Junie, please analyze the user research data we've collected and create user personas and scenarios for our Desktop GUI application. Ensure that the personas represent our key user groups and that the scenarios cover the primary use cases identified in the SRS. Once complete, share these artifacts for my review.
```

### For UX Artifacts
```
Hi Junie, please create a set of wireframes and user journey maps for the Desktop GUI application, ensuring that the user flows align with the requirements stated in the SRS. Include information architecture diagrams and navigation models. Ensure all designs consider the accessibility requirements in section 3.4.9 of the SRS. Share these UX artifacts so that I can review the proposed user interactions and suggest any tweaks.
```

### For UI Artifacts
```
Hi Junie, please generate high-fidelity UI mockups along with a detailed style guide for our application. The style guide should include color palettes (with accessibility contrast ratios), typography choices, spacing systems, and UI component guidelines. Ensure the designs comply with WCAG 2.2 AA standards as specified in our requirements. Once complete, please present the mockups and style guide for my review and approval.
```

### For Usability Testing
```
Hi Junie, please create a usability test plan for our application design. Include test scenarios, tasks, metrics for evaluation, and participant recruitment criteria. Ensure the test covers the key user journeys and focuses on validating both the functional requirements and the usability requirements specified in the SRS. Once complete, share the test plan for my review before we proceed with testing.
