# Quality in Use Test Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for evaluating the quality in use of the BackupManager application according to ISO/IEC 25010:2023 quality model. Quality in use refers to the degree to which the product can be used by specific users to meet their needs to achieve specific goals with effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and minimal risk in specific contexts of use.

## Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the BackupManager in enabling users to achieve their backup and recovery goals
2. Measure the efficiency with which users can complete backup and recovery tasks
3. Assess user satisfaction with the BackupManager interface and functionality
4. Identify and mitigate potential risks in the use of the application

## Quality in Use Characteristics

According to ISO/IEC 25010:2023, quality in use comprises the following characteristics:

### 1. Effectiveness

**Definition**: Accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
- Task completion rate (% of users who successfully complete backup/recovery tasks)
- Error rate (number of errors made during task completion)
- Task accuracy (% of tasks completed correctly)

**Test Methods**:
- Usability testing with representative users
- Task analysis with predefined success criteria
- Error logging during user sessions

**Target Metrics**:
- Task completion rate: >= 95%
- Error rate: <= 2 errors per task
- Task accuracy: >= 90%

### 2. Efficiency

**Definition**: Resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
- Time on task (time taken to complete specific backup/recovery operations)
- Clicks/steps to complete task (number of user interactions required)
- Learning time (time required for a new user to become proficient)

**Test Methods**:
- Time measurement during usability testing
- Interaction logging
- Learning curve analysis with new users

**Target Metrics**:
- Time on task: <= 2 minutes for common backup operations
- Clicks/steps: <= 5 clicks for primary functions
- Learning time: <= 30 minutes for basic proficiency

### 3. Satisfaction

**Definition**: Degree to which user needs are satisfied when a product is used in a specified context of use.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
- System Usability Scale (SUS) score
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- User satisfaction ratings for specific features
- Qualitative feedback on user experience

**Test Methods**:
- Post-test questionnaires (SUS, custom satisfaction surveys)
- User interviews
- Feedback collection during beta testing

**Target Metrics**:
- SUS score: >= 80 (above industry average)
- NPS: >= 40 (good)
- Feature satisfaction: >= 4 on 5-point scale

### 4. Risk Mitigation

**Definition**: Degree to which a product mitigates potential risk to economic status, human life, health, or the environment.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
- Data loss incidents during backup/recovery operations
- Security vulnerability exposure
- Recovery success rate in disaster scenarios
- Error prevention effectiveness

**Test Methods**:
- Simulated disaster recovery scenarios
- Security penetration testing
- Error injection testing
- Long-term reliability testing

**Target Metrics**:
- Data loss incidents: 0 during normal operation
- Recovery success rate: >= 99.9%
- Critical security vulnerabilities: 0 after remediation
- Error prevention: >= 95% of common user errors prevented

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios will be used to evaluate quality in use:

1. **First-time Setup**
   - User creates a new backup repository
   - User configures backup settings
   - User schedules automatic backups

2. **Routine Backup Operations**
   - User initiates manual backup
   - User monitors backup progress
   - User verifies backup completion

3. **File Recovery**
   - User searches for specific files to recover
   - User selects recovery location
   - User completes recovery operation

4. **Disaster Recovery**
   - User performs complete system recovery
   - User recovers from simulated repository corruption
   - User handles interrupted backup/recovery operations

5. **Repository Management**
   - User checks repository status
   - User performs repository maintenance
   - User migrates repository to new location

## Test Participants

Tests will be conducted with the following participant groups:

1. **Novice Users**: Individuals with limited technical experience
2. **IT Professionals**: Users with technical background but new to the application
3. **Experienced Users**: Users familiar with backup systems and operations

Each test group will include 5-8 participants for statistically significant results.

## Test Environment

Tests will be conducted in:

1. **Controlled Lab Environment**: For baseline measurements
2. **Remote Testing**: For real-world usage patterns
3. **Simulated Disaster Scenarios**: For recovery testing

## Test Schedule

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Preparation | Weeks 1-2 | Test plan finalization, participant recruitment, environment setup |
| Initial Testing | Weeks 3-4 | Baseline usability testing, effectiveness and efficiency measurement |
| Iteration | Weeks 5-6 | Improvements based on initial findings |
| Final Testing | Weeks 7-8 | Comprehensive quality in use evaluation |
| Analysis | Weeks 9-10 | Data analysis, reporting, recommendations |

## Reporting

Test results will be documented in:

1. **Quality in Use Test Report**: Comprehensive analysis of all quality characteristics
2. **Usability Findings**: Specific usability issues and recommendations
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies

## Relationship to Product Quality Model

This quality in use testing complements the product quality evaluation documented in the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 Quality Model Mapping (SRS ยง 4.13). While the product quality model focuses on inherent properties of the software, this test plan evaluates the actual user experience and outcomes when using the product.
