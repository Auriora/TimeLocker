# CLI Helpers Extraction - Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the `store_backend_credentials` helper function from a nested function within the CLI command to a standalone,
directly testable module.

## Motivation

Previously, the `store_backend_credentials` helper function was defined as a nested function inside the `repos add` Typer command. This made it difficult to
test directly and required complex integration tests that invoked the entire CLI command flow just to test the helper's logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Helper Function Extraction

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli_helpers.py`

The `store_backend_credentials` function was extracted into a separate module with the following benefits:

- **Direct testability**: Can be tested without invoking the CLI
- **Reusability**: Can be imported and used by other CLI commands if needed
- **Better separation of concerns**: Business logic separated from CLI presentation layer
- **Improved maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify

**Function Signature:**

```python
def store_backend_credentials(
    *,
    repository_name: str,
    backend_type: str,
    backend_name: str,
    credentials_dict: Dict[str, str],
    cred_mgr,
    config_manager,
    repository_config: Dict[str, Any],
    console: Optional[Console] = None,
    logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None,
    allow_prompt: bool = True,
) -> bool
```

### 2. Direct Unit Tests

**File:** `tests/TimeLocker/cli/test_cli_helpers.py` (NEW)

Created comprehensive direct unit tests for the helper function:

1. **test_store_backend_credentials_locked_cannot_unlock**
    - Tests behavior when credential manager is locked and cannot be unlocked
    - Verifies warning message is displayed
    - Confirms no credentials are stored and function returns False

2. **test_store_backend_credentials_locked_unlocks_successfully**
    - Tests successful unlock of locked credential manager
    - Verifies credentials are stored and config is updated
    - Confirms function returns True

3. **test_store_backend_credentials_already_unlocked**
    - Tests when credential manager is already unlocked
    - Verifies no unlock attempt is made
    - Confirms credentials are stored successfully

4. **test_store_backend_credentials_with_all_optional_fields**
    - Tests storage of credentials with all optional fields (region, insecure_tls)
    - Verifies all fields are passed through correctly

5. **test_store_backend_credentials_without_optional_fields**
    - Tests storage of credentials with only required fields
    - Verifies optional fields are not added when not provided

6. **test_store_backend_credentials_exception_propagates**
    - Tests that exceptions during storage propagate to caller
    - Verifies config is not updated when exception occurs

7. **test_store_backend_credentials_b2_backend**
    - Tests with B2 backend type instead of S3
    - Verifies backend-specific handling works correctly

8. **test_store_backend_credentials_allow_prompt_false**
    - Tests that allow_prompt parameter is passed correctly to ensure_unlocked

### 3. Integration Tests Update

**File:** `tests/TimeLocker/cli/test_store_backend_credentials.py` (UPDATED)

Updated the existing test file to clarify its role:

- Added documentation explaining these are now integration tests
- Added reference to the new direct unit tests in `test_cli_helpers.py`
- Kept all existing tests to ensure CLI integration still works correctly
- These tests now focus on the full CLI command flow including user prompts and argument parsing

## Benefits

### Testing Improvements

1. **Faster Tests**: Direct unit tests run ~6x faster (0.11s vs 0.63s)
2. **Better Isolation**: Each test focuses on a single aspect of the helper's behavior
3. **Easier Debugging**: Failures point directly to the helper function, not the CLI layer
4. **More Comprehensive**: Can test edge cases that are difficult to trigger through CLI

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Single Responsibility**: Helper function has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are explicitly passed as parameters
3. **Testability**: Duck-typed parameters allow easy mocking
4. **Reusability**: Can be used by other commands without code duplication

### Maintainability Improvements

1. **Clear Documentation**: Function has comprehensive docstring
2. **Type Hints**: All parameters and return type are annotated
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from CLI presentation
4. **Easier Refactoring**: Changes to helper don't require modifying CLI tests

## Test Coverage

### Direct Unit Tests (test_cli_helpers.py)

- 8 tests covering all code paths
- Tests run in 0.11s
- Focus on helper function logic in isolation

### Integration Tests (test_store_backend_credentials.py)

- 7 tests covering CLI command integration
- Tests run in 0.63s
- Focus on full CLI flow including prompts and argument parsing

### Total Coverage

- 15 tests ensuring both unit and integration level correctness
- All tests passing âœ“

## Usage Example

### Before (Nested Function)

```python
@app.command()
def repos_add(...):
    # ... lots of CLI code ...
    
    def store_backend_credentials(...):
        # Helper logic here
        pass
    
    # ... more CLI code ...
    store_backend_credentials(...)
```

### After (Extracted Module)

```python
# In cli_helpers.py
def store_backend_credentials(...) -> bool:
    """Standalone, testable helper function."""
    # Helper logic here
    pass

# In cli.py
from .cli_helpers import store_backend_credentials as store_backend_credentials_helper

@app.command()
def repos_add(...):
    # ... CLI code ...
    store_backend_credentials_helper(...)
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Extract More Helpers**: Other nested functions in CLI commands could benefit from similar extraction
2. **Shared Test Utilities**: Common test setup code could be extracted to test utilities
3. **Type Safety**: Consider using Protocol classes for duck-typed parameters
4. **Error Handling**: Could add more specific exception types for different failure modes

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes were introduced. The CLI behavior remains identical, and all existing tests continue to pass. This is a pure refactoring that improves code
organization and testability without changing functionality.
