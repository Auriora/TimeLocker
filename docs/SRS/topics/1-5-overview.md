# 1.5Â Overview

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a detailed description of the **Desktop Backup Application (DBA)**, outlining the functional and non-functional requirements that define its capabilities and constraints. It serves as the primary reference for developers, quality assurance teams, project managers, and stakeholders throughout the software development lifecycle. The document not only specifies what the application is intended to do but also establishes the boundaries of its functionality and scope, ensuring that all stakeholders share a common understanding of the system's objectives.

The SRS is divided into multiple sections to facilitate easy navigation and understanding. 

Section 1 introduces the purpose of the document, the intended audience, and the scope of the DBA. Key definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations used throughout the document are also provided to ensure clarity and consistency. 

Section 2 offers a high-level description of the product's context, highlighting its architecture, user characteristics, assumptions, dependencies, and constraints. This section aids in establishing the groundwork for the detailed requirements that follow.

Section 3 is the core of the document, detailing the specific functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements are grouped into logical categories such as repository management, backup operations, recovery operations, and security, providing a comprehensive breakdown of the features the application must support. Non-functional requirements, such as performance, reliability, usability, security compliance, and accessibility, ensure the product meets quality standards and operational expectations. Additionally, this section links requirements to real-world use cases to illustrate their relevance within the application workflow.

Finally, supporting references and standards are included to provide context and ensure alignment with industry-best practices. These include relevant documentation such as GDPR regulations, OWASP guidelines, and ISO/IEEE standards for usability, safety, and software engineering. By organizing the document into these logical sections, the SRS ensures that stakeholders can quickly locate the information they need while fostering a shared understanding of the project's goals and priorities.
