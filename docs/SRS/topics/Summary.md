# Summary

The Desktop Backup Application addresses the growing need for secure, reliable, and user-friendly backup solutions in personal and small business domains. Its modular architecture and compliance-centric design ensure long-term adaptability and scalability in a rapidly evolving data landscape.

The DBA is a standalone desktop client that provides a modern GUI for the Restic engine, along with scheduling, policy enforcement, and reporting tools. Integration capabilities allow interoperability with system schedulers, credential stores, and remote storage services (e.g., S3, SMB, NFS). Additionally, it features a CLI and JSON-RPC/REST API for advanced automation scenarios.

**Purpose**
The **Desktop Backup Application (DBA)** is a cross-platform desktop client designed to simplify file-system backups with a user-friendly interface and advanced functionalities. This document outlines its scope, requirements, and use cases, providing developers, project managers, and stakeholders with a clear understanding of the product’s design and goals.

**Scope**
The DBA will primarily support Linux desktops, with Windows and macOS included in future development. It uses the **Restic CLI** as its backup engine, offering features like:
- Full, incremental, and scheduled backups.
- Policy-based retention, encryption, and auditing.
- Support for multiple storage backends (local disk, SFTP, S3, etc.).
- Point-in-time and partial restores.

The **DBA will not** provide centralized server functionality or replace existing OS-level tools but aims to enhance personal backup workflows.
