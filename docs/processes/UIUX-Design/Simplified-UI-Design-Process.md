# UI Design Process

This document outlines a streamlined approach to UI design for solo developers working with AI assistance.

## 1. Design System Creation

Establish a minimal design system to maintain consistency:

- Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral colors)
- Typography (1-2 font families with defined sizes for headings and body text)
- Component library (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- Spacing and layout guidelines

**AI Prompts for Design System:**

- "What color palette would work well for this type of application?"
- "What typography choices would be appropriate for this application?"
- "What are the essential UI components I need to design for this application?"

## 2. Wireframing

Create low-fidelity representations of key screens:

- Focus on layout and information hierarchy
- Use simple shapes and placeholders
- Annotate with functional notes

**AI Prompts for Wireframing:**

- "What layout would work best for this screen with these elements?"
- "How should I organize these elements to create a clear visual hierarchy?"
- "What patterns do similar applications use for this type of screen?"

## 3. UI Mockups

Develop higher-fidelity designs based on wireframes:

- Apply the design system elements
- Focus on a few key screens first
- Maintain consistency across screens

**AI Prompts for UI Mockups:**

- "How can I apply my design system to this wireframe?"
- "What visual treatments would make this interface more intuitive?"
- "How can I visually distinguish between primary and secondary actions?"

## 4. Prototype Creation (Optional)

For complex interactions, create simple prototypes:

- Focus on critical user flows
- Test navigation patterns
- Validate complex interactions

**AI Prompts for Prototyping:**

- "What are the essential interactions I should prototype for this feature?"
- "How should this transition or animation work to improve usability?"
- "What feedback should the user receive during this interaction?"
