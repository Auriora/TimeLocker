# UX Design Process

This document outlines a streamlined approach to UX design for solo developers working with AI assistance.

## 1. User Persona Development

Instead of conducting user interviews, create simplified personas based on:

- Your understanding of the target users
- Industry knowledge and best practices
- AI-generated insights about typical users

**AI Prompts for Persona Development:**

- "Based on this application type, what user personas should I consider?"
- "What are the key characteristics, goals, and pain points for a typical user of this application?"
- "How would different types of users interact with this feature?"

## 2. User Journey Mapping

Create simplified user journeys that outline:

- Entry points to the application
- Key tasks users need to accomplish
- Potential pain points in the process
- Exit points and desired outcomes

**AI Prompts for Journey Mapping:**

- "What would a typical user journey look like for accomplishing [task] in this application?"
- "What are the potential pain points in this user journey?"
- "How can I simplify this journey to require fewer steps?"

## 3. Information Architecture

Organize application content and functionality in a logical structure:

- Create a simple site map or application flow
- Define navigation patterns
- Organize content hierarchically
- Establish naming conventions

**AI Prompts for Information Architecture:**

- "What would be a logical organization for these features and content?"
- "What navigation pattern would work best for this type of application?"
- "How should I name these sections to be intuitive for users?"
