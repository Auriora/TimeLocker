# TimeLocker MVP Implementation Action Plan

Here's a practical action plan to implement the TimeLocker MVP based on your development plan:

## 1. Repository Management Implementation

**Action Items:**

- Complete LocalResticRepository implementation
- Implement secure credential storage
- Create repository configuration UI
- Write unit tests

**AI Prompt:**

````markdown path=prompts/repository_management.md mode=EDIT
# Repository Management Implementation

## Context
I need to implement the repository management feature for TimeLocker, focusing on:
- Local repository creation and configuration (FR-RM-001, FR-RM-003)
- Secure credential management (FR-SEC-002)

## Current Code Status
The implementation is partial in src/TimeLocker/restic/restic_repository.py

## Request
Please help me complete the LocalResticRepository implementation with:
1. Methods for repository initialization
2. Secure password/credential storage
3. Configuration management
4. Error handling for common repository issues

Include appropriate unit tests that verify repository operations work correctly.

## 2. Backup Operations Implementation

**Action Items:**

- Complete FileSelection implementation
- Implement backup execution workflow
- Create backup verification functionality
- Develop backup UI components
- Write unit tests

**AI Prompt:**

````markdown path=prompts/backup_operations.md mode=EDIT
# Backup Operations Implementation

## Context
I need to implement the core backup operations for TimeLocker, focusing on:
- Full and incremental backups with deduplication (FR-BK-001)
- File/directory inclusion and exclusion patterns (FR-BK-003)
- Backup verification and integrity checking (FR-BK-004)

## Current Code Status
Partial implementation exists in:
- src/TimeLocker/backup_manager.py
- src/TimeLocker/backup_repository.py
- src/TimeLocker/file_selections.py

## Request
Please help me complete the backup operations implementation with:
1. FileSelection class for handling inclusion/exclusion patterns
2. BackupManager methods for executing full/incremental backups
3. Verification functionality to ensure backup integrity
4. Error handling and retry mechanisms

Include unit tests that verify backup operations work correctly with various file patterns.
````

## 3. Recovery Operations Implementation

**Action Items:**

- Implement snapshot listing functionality
- Create restore operation workflow
- Develop snapshot selection UI
- Write unit tests

**AI Prompt:**

````markdown path=prompts/recovery_operations.md mode=EDIT
# Recovery Operations Implementation

## Context
I need to implement the recovery operations for TimeLocker, focusing on:
- Full restore operations (FR-RC-001)
- Simple snapshot selection (FR-RC-002)

## Current Code Status
This functionality needs to be implemented from scratch.

## Request
Please help me implement the recovery operations with:
1. SnapshotManager class for listing and selecting snapshots
2. RestoreManager for executing restore operations
3. Methods to verify successful restoration
4. Error handling for recovery edge cases

Include unit tests that verify recovery operations work correctly with various scenarios.
````

## 4. Integration and Security Implementation

**Action Items:**

- Implement data encryption
- Create status reporting functionality
- Develop configuration management UI
- Write integration tests

**AI Prompt:**

````markdown path=prompts/integration_security.md mode=EDIT
# Integration and Security Implementation

## Context
I need to implement security features and integrate all components for TimeLocker, focusing on:
- Data encryption at rest and in transit (FR-SEC-001)
- Status reporting and notifications (FR-MON-002, FR-MON-003)
- Configuration management (FR-RM-003)

## Current Code Status
Partial implementations exist across multiple files, but need integration.

## Request
Please help me implement:
1. Security service for handling encryption (leveraging Restic's capabilities)
2. Status reporting system for backup/restore operations
3. Configuration management UI components
4. Integration points between all existing components

Include integration tests that verify the complete workflow functions correctly.
````

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

**Action Items:**

- Create comprehensive test suite
- Implement automated testing workflow
- Perform manual testing of key user flows
- Fix identified issues

**AI Prompt:**

````markdown path=prompts/testing_qa.md mode=EDIT
# Testing and Quality Assurance

## Context
I need to implement a comprehensive testing strategy for TimeLocker MVP, including:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- Test automation setup

## Current Code Status
Some unit tests exist but coverage is incomplete.

## Request
Please help me:
1. Create a comprehensive test plan covering all MVP features
2. Implement missing unit tests for core components
3. Develop integration tests for complete workflows
4. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

Focus on critical paths and edge cases that could affect data integrity.
