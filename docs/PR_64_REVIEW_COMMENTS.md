## Review Comment #1: Document repository_name Parameter (S3)

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/restic/Repositories/s3.py` (line 37)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** Documentation  

### Comment
The new repository_name parameter should be documented in the class and method docstrings to explain its purpose for per-repository credential lookup.

### Context
The `S3ResticRepository.__init__()` method now accepts a `repository_name` parameter but lacks documentation explaining its purpose.

### Recommendation
**SHOULD IMPLEMENT** - Add docstring documentation for the `repository_name` parameter explaining that it's used for per-repository credential lookup from the credential manager.

### Implementation Complexity
Low - Simple documentation addition

---

## Review Comment #2: Document repository_name Parameter (B2)

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/restic/Repositories/b2.py` (line 33)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** Documentation  

### Comment
The new repository_name parameter should be documented in the class and method docstrings to explain its purpose for per-repository credential lookup.

### Context
The `B2ResticRepository.__init__()` method now accepts a `repository_name` parameter but lacks documentation.

### Recommendation
**SHOULD IMPLEMENT** - Add docstring documentation for the `repository_name` parameter.

### Implementation Complexity
Low - Simple documentation addition

## Review Comment #3: URI Field Lookup Robustness (credentials-set)

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (line 2108)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Bug / Robustness  

### Comment
This code assumes 'uri' field exists but the repository configuration might use 'location' field instead based on the schema. Should use a more robust field lookup that handles both legacy 'uri' and current 'location' fields.

### Current Code
```python
uri = repo_config.get('uri', '')
```

### Suggested Fix
```python
uri = repo_config.get('uri') or repo_config.get('location', '')
```

### Recommendation
**MUST IMPLEMENT** - This is a critical bug that could cause the command to fail with repositories using the 'location' field.

### Implementation Complexity
Low - Simple one-line change, but needs to be applied in multiple locations

## Review Comment #4: Code Duplication - AWS Credentials Storage

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (lines 1872-1905)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Code Duplication  

### Comment
There is duplicated code for storing AWS credentials in both the if and else branches. This logic should be extracted into a helper function to eliminate duplication and improve maintainability.

### Context
The `repos_add` command has identical credential storage logic in both the locked and unlocked credential manager branches.

### Suggested Fix
Extract the credential storage logic into a helper function that can be called from both branches.

### Recommendation
**SHOULD IMPLEMENT** - This is a clear DRY violation that makes the code harder to maintain.

### Implementation Complexity
Medium - Requires extracting logic into a helper function and handling the `nonlocal` variable properly

## Review Comment #5: Code Duplication - B2 Credentials Storage

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (lines 1903-1931)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Code Duplication  

### Comment
There is duplicated code for storing B2 credentials in both the if and else branches, similar to the AWS credentials issue. This logic should also be extracted into a helper function to eliminate duplication.

### Context
Same duplication pattern as AWS credentials but for B2 backend.

### Recommendation
**SHOULD IMPLEMENT** - Same issue as comment #4, should be fixed together.

### Implementation Complexity
Medium - Same as comment #4

## Review Comment #6: URI Field Lookup Robustness (credentials-remove)

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (line 2182)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Bug / Robustness  

### Comment
These lines also assume 'uri' field exists but should handle both 'uri' and 'location' fields consistently with the repository configuration schema, similar to the issue in line 2108.

### Recommendation
**MUST IMPLEMENT** - Same critical issue as comment #3, needs to be fixed in all credential management commands.

### Implementation Complexity
Low - Same fix as comment #3

---

## Review Comment #7: URI Field Lookup Robustness (credentials-show)

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (line 2255)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Bug / Robustness  

### Comment
These lines also assume 'uri' field exists but should handle both 'uri' and 'location' fields consistently with the repository configuration schema, similar to the issue in line 2108.

### Recommendation
**MUST IMPLEMENT** - Same critical issue as comments #3 and #6.

### Implementation Complexity
Low - Same fix as comments #3 and #6

## Review Comment #8: Performance - Credential Access Tracking

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/security/credential_manager.py` (line 572)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Actions Bot  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** Performance  

### Comment
The credential store is being saved on every credential retrieval to update access tracking. This could impact performance if credentials are accessed frequently.

### Suggested Improvements
**Option 1:** Only update tracking periodically (e.g., every 10th access)
```python
if backend_creds.get("access_count", 0) % 10 == 0:
    backend_creds["last_accessed"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    backend_creds["access_count"] = backend_creds.get("access_count", 0) + 1
    self._save_credentials(credentials)
else:
    backend_creds["access_count"] = backend_creds.get("access_count", 0) + 1
```

**Option 2:** Make access tracking optional via parameter
```python
def get_repository_backend_credentials(self, repository_id: str, backend_type: str, track_access: bool = True):
```

### Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - This is an optimization that may not be necessary unless performance issues are observed.

### Implementation Complexity
Medium - Requires design decision on tracking strategy

## Review Comment #9: Bare Except Clause

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (line 2091)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Actions Bot  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Error Handling  

### Comment
Using a bare `except:` clause catches all exceptions, including system exits and keyboard interrupts, which may not be intended.

### Suggested Fix
```python
try:
    repo_config = config_manager.get_repository(name)
except (RepositoryNotFoundError, KeyError, ValueError) as e:
    show_error_panel("Repository Not Found", f"Repository '{name}' not found")
    raise typer.Exit(1)
```

### Recommendation
**MUST IMPLEMENT** - Bare except clauses are a Python anti-pattern and can hide serious bugs.

### Implementation Complexity
Low - Simple exception type specification

## Review Comment #10: Nested Function Complexity

**File:** `src/TimeLocker/cli.py` (line 1879)  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Actions Bot  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** Code Organization  

### Comment
The nested function `store_aws_credentials` creates a complex control flow and captures many variables from the outer scope. Consider extracting this logic to improve readability.

### Suggested Improvement
Extract to a separate method or simplify the control flow to avoid nested function definitions.

### Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - This would improve code organization but is related to the duplication issue in comments #4 and #5.

### Implementation Complexity
Medium - Should be addressed together with comments #4 and #5
