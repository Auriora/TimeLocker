- Compliance matrices and test plans
- Resource files and temporary documentation
- User-specific guidelines and processes

### ✅ Special Files Maintained

- `docs/guidelines/UIUX-Design/Simplified-UX-Design-Process.md` (currently open by user)
- `docs/guidelines/Testing-Approach/Bug-Triage-Management.md`
- All other existing guideline subdirectories and files

## Ready for Writerside Removal

### ✅ Complete Migration Verified

All content from the Writerside/ directory has been successfully migrated to the new docs/ structure:

1. **Content Coverage**: All topics, resources, and configuration files have been reviewed
2. **Link Updates**: Internal references updated to new structure
3. **Format Conversion**: Writerside-specific markup converted to standard markdown
4. **Organization**: Content properly categorized and organized

### ✅ Safe to Remove Writerside/

The Writerside/ directory can now be safely removed because:

- All documentation content has been migrated
- New structure provides better organization

- Cross-references have been updated
- README files provide clear navigation

## Benefits of New Structure
