## Introduction

This document outlines a streamlined development plan for the TimeLocker project, designed specifically for a solo developer using an AI assistant for 80-90% of
the development work. The plan focuses on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly by eliminating unnecessary process overhead while maintaining
high-quality standards. It includes the core features for the MVP, implementation steps, timeline, testing strategy, and AI utilization approach.

## Solo Developer AI-Driven Process

### Core Principles

1. **Minimize Process Overhead**: Eliminate all ceremonies and documentation that don't directly contribute to product quality
2. **Maximize AI Leverage**: Use AI for as much of the development work as possible
3. **Focus on Outcomes**: Prioritize working software over comprehensive documentation
4. **Iterative Development**: Build small, testable increments rather than large batches of work

### Streamlined Process Overview

The entire development process is condensed into three simple phases:

1. **Plan Phase** (10-15% of development time)
    - Maintain a simple prioritized list of features/tasks
    - For each feature, write a brief description of what it should do
    - Sketch any necessary UI elements or data structures
    - Use AI to help refine feature descriptions and suggest edge cases

2. **Build Phase** (70-80% of development time)
    - Write effective prompts for the AI assistant
    - Review and refine AI-generated code
    - Integrate components and resolve any issues
    - Document key design decisions (minimal, focused on future maintenance)
    - Use AI to generate code, tests, documentation, and debug issues

3. **Verify Phase** (10-15% of development time)
    - Run automated tests
    - Manually test key user flows
    - Fix any issues found
    - Verify performance and security
    - Use AI to generate additional test cases and analyze code for issues

### Tracking Progress

For a solo developer, complex tracking systems add unnecessary overhead. Instead:

- Maintain a simple list of features with statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Track only essential metrics that provide value:
    - Features completed per week
    - Known bugs/issues
    - Test coverage for critical components

## System Architecture

TimeLocker follows a layered architecture that provides clear separation of concerns and enables extensibility:

    - Sprint 4 integrates and refines the implementation

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**:
    - Each sprint includes specific tasks for writing unit tests
    - Integration tests will be developed in Sprint 4
    - Test coverage will be measured and reported in sprint reviews
    - Acceptance tests will be updated based on implementation progress

4. **UI Implementation Gap**:
    - UI components are explicitly included in each sprint's technical tasks

    - Fix critical bugs immediately
    - Use AI to help diagnose and fix issues

3. **Quality Metrics**
    - Code coverage percentage
    - Number of failing tests
    - Number of open bugs
    - Performance benchmarks for critical operations

## AI Utilization Strategy

### Effective AI Prompting

1. **Context-Rich Prompts**
    - **Technique**: Provide sufficient context about the codebase and requirements
    - **Example**: "Given the existing BackupRepository class that handles X, Y, and Z, implement a LocalRepository class that adds support for local filesystem
      operations"
    - **Benefit**: Generates more relevant and integrated code

2. **Iterative Refinement**
    - **Technique**: Start with high-level prompts, then refine with more specific requests
    - **Example**: First request a class structure, then request specific method implementations
    - **Benefit**: Builds code incrementally with better control over the output

3. **Multi-Solution Requests**
    - **Technique**: Ask AI to provide multiple approaches to solving complex problems
    - **Example**: "Suggest three different approaches to implement secure credential storage"
    - **Benefit**: Provides options to choose from based on tradeoffs

4. **Code Review Prompts**
    - **Technique**: Ask AI to review generated code for issues
    - **Example**: "Review this code for potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and edge cases"
    - **Benefit**: Identifies potential problems before testing

### AI Tools and Integration

1. **Development Environment**
    - **Tool**: IDE with integrated AI coding assistant
    - **Purpose**: In-line code generation and completion
    - **Usage**: Primary interface for code development

2. **Documentation Generation**
    - **Tool**: AI documentation assistant
    - **Purpose**: Generate and maintain code documentation
    - **Usage**: Create docstrings, README updates, and user guides

3. **Testing Support**
    - **Tool**: AI test generation
    - **Purpose**: Create comprehensive test cases
    - **Usage**: Generate unit tests, integration tests, and test data

4. **Code Analysis**
    - **Tool**: AI code analyzer
    - **Purpose**: Identify code quality issues and suggest improvements
    - **Usage**: Regular code reviews and refactoring assistance

### AI Workflow Integration

1. **Planning Phase**
    - Use AI to analyze requirements and suggest implementation approaches
    - Generate data models and interface definitions
    - Identify potential edge cases and challenges

2. **Building Phase**
    - Generate initial code implementations
    - Refine and optimize code through iterative prompting
    - Create tests alongside implementation
    - Generate documentation as code is developed

3. **Verification Phase**
    - Generate additional test cases for edge conditions
    - Analyze code for potential issues
    - Help troubleshoot and fix bugs
    - Suggest performance optimizations

### Maintaining Code Quality with AI

1. **Code Consistency**
    - Provide style guidelines in prompts
    - Use AI to refactor code for consistency
    - Maintain a prompt template library for common patterns

2. **Knowledge Retention**
    - Document key design decisions and rationale
    - Use AI to generate explanatory comments for complex logic
    - Maintain a simple architecture document that explains system design

3. **Continuous Learning**
    - Track effective prompting patterns
    - Note areas where AI assistance is most/least effective
    - Refine prompting strategy based on results

## Conclusion

This MVP Development Plan provides a streamlined framework for developing the TimeLocker project using a solo developer AI-driven approach. By following this
plan, the developer will be able to:

1. Minimize process overhead while maintaining high-quality standards
2. Leverage AI assistance for 80-90% of the development work
3. Implement the core features needed for the MVP in a significantly accelerated timeframe
4. Ensure quality through AI-assisted testing strategies
5. Maintain code quality and knowledge retention despite being a solo developer

The plan is designed to be flexible and pragmatic, focusing on outcomes rather than process. The developer should adapt the approach based on experience with AI
tools and the specific challenges encountered during implementation.
