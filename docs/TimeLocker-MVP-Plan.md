## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for transitioning the TimeLocker project from a waterfall development approach to an agile methodology, with the
goal of delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly. The plan includes specific steps for implementing the MVP, a timeline with milestones, testing
strategies, and a communication plan for the development team.

## Plan of Action for Agile Transition

### Current State Assessment

The TimeLocker project is currently following a waterfall development approach, characterized by:

- Comprehensive upfront documentation
- Sequential development phases
- Detailed requirements specification before implementation
- Limited flexibility for changes once development has started

While this approach has provided a solid foundation of documentation and architecture, it has slowed down the delivery of working software. The project needs to
transition to an agile approach to accelerate the delivery of an MVP.

### Agile Methodology Selection

For the TimeLocker project, we will adopt a **Scrum-based approach with Kanban elements**:

- **Scrum elements** to provide structure:
    - 2-week sprints
    - Sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings
    - Defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)
    - Potentially shippable increments at the end of each sprint

- **Kanban elements** to provide visibility and flow:
    - Visual board to track work items
    - Work-in-progress (WIP) limits
    - Continuous flow of features when appropriate

This hybrid approach provides both the structure needed for team coordination and the flexibility required for rapid development.

### Key Transition Steps

1. **Reorganize Requirements into a Product Backlog** (Week 1)
    - Convert the existing requirements into user stories
    - Prioritize stories based on the MVP criteria
    - Estimate story complexity using story points

2. **Establish Agile Ceremonies** (Week 1)
    - Set up sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives
    - Define timeboxes for each ceremony
    - Create templates for meeting agendas and outcomes

3. **Set Up Agile Tools** (Week 1)
    - Implement a Kanban board (physical or digital)
    - Configure work item tracking system
    - Establish documentation practices for agile artifacts

4. **Define Working Agreements** (Week 1)
    - Establish Definition of Ready and Definition of Done
    - Create coding standards and review processes
    - Define communication protocols

5. **Conduct Initial Sprint Planning** (Week 2)
    - Select high-priority user stories for the first sprint
    - Break down stories into tasks
    - Commit to sprint goals

6. **Begin Iterative Development** (Week 2 onwards)
    - Execute sprints with daily stand-ups
    - Conduct sprint reviews and retrospectives
    - Continuously refine the product backlog

### Metrics for Measuring Transition Success

- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Time from story start to completion
- **Defect Rate**: Number of defects found per story
- **Sprint Goal Achievement**: Percentage of sprint goals met
- **Team Satisfaction**: Measured through retrospective feedback

## System Architecture

TimeLocker follows a layered architecture that provides clear separation of concerns and enables extensibility:

### Addressing Traceability Gaps

The Requirements Traceability Matrix identified several gaps that will be addressed as part of our Agile implementation:

1. **Design Documentation Gap**:
    - We will create design documentation as part of each sprint's deliverables
    - Architecture and component documentation will be updated as the implementation progresses
    - Design decisions will be documented in the sprint review meetings

2. **Implementation Gaps**:
    - The MVP sprints are specifically structured to address the most critical implementation gaps
    - Sprint 1 focuses on repository management implementation
    - Sprint 2 addresses backup operations implementation
    - Sprint 3 completes recovery operations implementation
    - Sprint 4 integrates and refines the implementation

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**:
    - Each sprint includes specific tasks for writing unit tests
    - Integration tests will be developed in Sprint 4
    - Test coverage will be measured and reported in sprint reviews
    - Acceptance tests will be updated based on implementation progress

4. **UI Implementation Gap**:
    - UI components are explicitly included in each sprint's technical tasks
    - We will follow a consistent UI design approach across all components
    - User feedback will be incorporated into UI refinements in Sprint 4
