# Test Plan

## Project Information

- **Project Name**: TimeLocker
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2023-04-23
- **Author**: TimeLocker Development Team

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This test plan outlines the testing approach for the TimeLocker project, a high-level Python interface for backup operations primarily using the Restic backup
tool. It defines the testing objectives, strategy, and resources required to ensure the quality and reliability of the TimeLocker application.

### 1.2 Scope

This test plan covers the testing of all core functionality of the TimeLocker application, including:

- Repository management
- Backup operations
- Recovery operations
- Security operations
- User interface

Out of scope for this test plan:

- Performance testing of underlying Restic tool
- Testing of third-party storage backends (S3, B2, etc.)
- Hardware-specific testing

### 1.3 References

- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- TimeLocker Architecture Document
- Restic Documentation
- TimeLocker User Guide

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Testing Objectives

- Verify that the TimeLocker application meets all functional requirements
- Ensure the application is reliable and stable
- Validate that the application handles error conditions gracefully
- Confirm that the application is secure and protects user data
- Verify that the application is usable and provides a good user experience

### 2.2 Testing Types

The following types of testing will be performed:

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
- **Functional Testing**: Testing complete features from a user perspective
- **Acceptance Testing**: Verifying that the system meets the requirements specified in the SRS
- **Performance Testing**: Testing system performance under various conditions
- **Security Testing**: Testing for security vulnerabilities

### 2.3 Testing Tools

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **Robot Framework**: For acceptance testing
- **Coverage.py**: For measuring test coverage
- **Locust**: For performance testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: For security testing

### 2.4 Testing Environment

- **Development Environment**: For unit and integration testing
- **Staging Environment**: For functional, acceptance, and performance testing
- **Production-like Environment**: For final acceptance testing

## 3. Test Items

The following components will be tested:

- **Repository Management**: Creation, configuration, and deletion of backup repositories
- **Backup Operations**: Creation, validation, and scheduling of backups
- **Recovery Operations**: Restoration of files and directories from backups
- **Security Operations**: Data encryption, access control, and privacy features
- **User Interface**: Command-line interface and graphical user interface

## 4. Testing Schedule

- **Unit Testing**: Throughout development
- **Integration Testing**: Weekly
- **Functional Testing**: Bi-weekly
- **Acceptance Testing**: At the end of each sprint
- **Performance Testing**: Monthly
- **Security Testing**: Monthly

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk                                  | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incomplete test coverage              | Medium      | High   | Implement code coverage metrics and set minimum thresholds     |
| Environment setup issues              | Medium      | Medium | Document environment setup process and automate where possible |
| Test data management                  | Low         | Medium | Create scripts to generate and manage test data                |
| Integration with third-party services | High        | Medium | Use mocks and stubs for testing                                |
| Time constraints                      | Medium      | High   | Prioritize testing based on risk and importance                |
