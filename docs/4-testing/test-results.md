## Defects Summary

| Defect ID | Description                                                         | Severity | Status | Related Test Case |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| DEF-001   | Directory structure not maintained when restoring specific files    | Major    | Open   | TC-RO-002         |
| DEF-002   | Progress information not updating in real-time during large backups | Minor    | Open   | TC-BO-001         |
| DEF-003   | UI freezes momentarily when selecting large directories for backup  | Minor    | Open   | TC-BO-001         |

## Risk Assessment

Based on the test results, the following risks have been identified:

1. **Restore Functionality**: The issue with restoring specific files while maintaining directory structure (DEF-001) poses a moderate risk to the core
   functionality of the application. Users may not be able to restore files to their original structure, which could impact usability.

2. **Performance with Large Backups**: The issues with progress information (DEF-002) and UI freezing (DEF-003) indicate potential performance problems with
   large backups. This could affect user experience but does not impact the core functionality.

## Recommendations

1. Fix the directory structure issue (DEF-001) before release, as this affects core functionality.
2. Address the performance issues (DEF-002, DEF-003) in a subsequent update if they cannot be resolved before the initial release.
3. Conduct additional testing with larger data sets to identify any other performance issues.
4. Implement automated regression testing to ensure that fixed issues do not recur in future releases.

## Conclusion

The TimeLocker application is generally stable and functional, with most test cases passing successfully. The identified issues are manageable and should be
addressed according to their severity. With the resolution of the major defect (DEF-001), the application should be ready for release.
