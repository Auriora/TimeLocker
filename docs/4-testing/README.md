This section contains test plans, test cases, test results, and testing methodologies for the TimeLocker project.

## Core Testing Documents

### [Testing Overview](testing-overview.md)

Comprehensive overview of the testing approach, strategies, and methodologies for the TimeLocker project.

### [Test Plan](test-plan.md)

Detailed test plan outlining testing objectives, strategy, resources, and schedule for all phases of testing.

### [Test Results](test-results.md)

Documentation of test execution results, including pass/fail status, defects found, and resolution tracking.

## Test Documentation Structure

### Test Planning

- **Test Strategy**: Comprehensive approach to testing all system components
- **Test Objectives**: Verification of functional and non-functional requirements
- **Resource Requirements**: Personnel, hardware, and software needed for testing
- **Risk Assessment**: Identification and mitigation of testing risks

### Test Types

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation using pytest
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
- **Functional Testing**: Testing complete features from user perspective
- **Acceptance Testing**: Verifying system meets SRS requirements using Robot Framework
- **Performance Testing**: Testing system performance using Locust
- **Security Testing**: Testing for vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP

### Test Cases and Scenarios

#### [Acceptance Tests](acceptance-tests/)

Automated acceptance tests that verify the system meets the requirements specified in the SRS.

#### [Test Cases](test-cases/)

Detailed test cases covering all functional areas:

- Repository Management
- Backup Operations
- Recovery Operations
- Security Operations
- User Interface
- Error Handling
- Performance
- Integration

## Testing Tools and Framework

### Primary Testing Tools

- **pytest**: Unit and integration testing framework
- **Robot Framework**: Acceptance testing and behavior-driven development
- **Coverage.py**: Code coverage measurement and reporting
- **Locust**: Performance and load testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security vulnerability testing

### Testing Environment

- **Development Environment**: For unit and integration testing
- **Staging Environment**: For functional, acceptance, and performance testing
- **Production-like Environment**: For final acceptance testing

## Test Execution Strategy

### Continuous Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run automatically on every code commit
- **Integration Tests**: Execute weekly during development
- **Functional Tests**: Run bi-weekly for feature validation
- **Acceptance Tests**: Execute at the end of each sprint
- **Performance Tests**: Run monthly for performance validation
- **Security Tests**: Execute monthly for vulnerability assessment

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Functional Coverage**: 100% of functional requirements
- **Acceptance Coverage**: 100% of acceptance criteria
- **Performance Coverage**: All critical performance scenarios
- **Security Coverage**: All security requirements and common vulnerabilities

## Quality Metrics

### Test Metrics Tracking

- **Test Execution Rate**: Percentage of planned tests executed
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests passing
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects per component
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Response times and throughput metrics

### Quality Gates

- All unit tests must pass before code merge
- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All acceptance tests must pass before release
- Performance tests must meet defined benchmarks
- Security tests must show no critical vulnerabilities

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy

- **Synthetic Data**: Generated test data for consistent testing
- **Anonymized Data**: Real data with sensitive information removed
- **Mock Data**: Simulated external system responses
- **Test Fixtures**: Predefined test scenarios and configurations

### Test Environment Management

- **Environment Provisioning**: Automated setup of test environments
- **Data Refresh**: Regular refresh of test data
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments for different test types
- **Configuration Management**: Consistent environment configurations

## Defect Management

### Defect Tracking Process

1. **Discovery**: Defects identified during test execution
2. **Logging**: Detailed defect reports with reproduction steps
3. **Triage**: Priority and severity assignment
4. **Assignment**: Developer assignment for resolution
5. **Verification**: Test team verification of fixes
6. **Closure**: Final validation and closure

### Defect Classification

- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Major functionality broken, significant performance issues
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, usability problems
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor enhancements

## Testing Best Practices

### Test Design Principles

- **Test Early and Often**: Implement testing throughout development
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on high-risk and high-value areas
- **Automation First**: Automate repetitive and regression tests
- **Maintainable Tests**: Write clear, maintainable test code
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Use data-driven approaches for comprehensive coverage

### Test Maintenance

- **Regular Review**: Periodic review and update of test cases
- **Refactoring**: Continuous improvement of test code
- **Documentation**: Keep test documentation current
- **Training**: Ensure team knowledge of testing practices
