## About TimeLocker

TimeLocker is a high-level Python interface for backup operations, primarily using the Restic backup tool. It simplifies backup operations through an
object-oriented API that handles repository management, file selection patterns, and backup configurations across multiple storage backends.

This documentation provides comprehensive coverage of requirements, design, implementation, and testing for the TimeLocker project.
