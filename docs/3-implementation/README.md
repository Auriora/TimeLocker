## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Virtual environment (`.venv/` directory)
- Git for version control
- Restic backup tool
- SQLite for development database

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Auriora/TimeLocker.git
cd TimeLocker

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies (PEP 660)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Start development server
python -m timelocker.main
```

### Development Tools

- **IDE**: PyCharm, VS Code, or similar Python IDE
- **Testing**: pytest for unit testing, Robot Framework for acceptance testing
- **Code Quality**: pylint, black, mypy for code analysis and formatting
- **Documentation**: Sphinx for API documentation generation

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

- **Repository Manager**: Handles backup repository operations
- **Backup Engine**: Manages backup creation and scheduling
- **Recovery Engine**: Handles file and system restoration
- **Security Manager**: Manages encryption and access control
- **UI Framework**: Provides user interface and user experience
- **API Server**: REST API for programmatic access

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI framework
- **Frontend**: Modern web technologies (React/Vue.js)
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Backup Tool**: Restic CLI integration
- **Security**: Industry-standard encryption and authentication protocols
