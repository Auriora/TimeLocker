## Test Coverage Analysis Summary

This PR implements comprehensive fixes across CLI commands, credential management, S3 repositories, and backup orchestration. While existing tests cover basic
functionality, several critical areas need additional test coverage to ensure the robustness of the new features and bug fixes.

## Key Test Coverage Gaps Identified

### 1. Per-Repository Credential Management (High Priority)

**Missing Tests:**

- `store_backend_credentials` helper function in CLI
- Credential resolution chain in S3ResticRepository
- `store_repository_backend_credentials` method in CredentialManager
- CLI commands: `repos credentials set/show/remove`

**Rationale:** These are security-critical features that handle sensitive credential storage and retrieval. Comprehensive testing ensures proper encryption,
access control, and error handling.

### 2. S3 Repository Enhancements (High Priority)

**Missing Tests:**

- Enhanced `backend_env()` method with endpoint and insecure_tls support
- Credential resolution chain (credential manager ‚Üí constructor ‚Üí environment)
- Lightweight `validate()` method that doesn't make network calls
- Repository initialization with per-repository credentials

**Rationale:** S3 repository changes enable support for S3-compatible services like MinIO. Testing ensures proper credential resolution and environment
configuration.

### 3. CLI Integration Points (Medium Priority)

**Missing Tests:**

- Repository name parameter passing in backup commands
- Enhanced error handling and validation in repository operations
- Integration between CLI commands and credential manager
- Repository initialization with stored credentials

**Rationale:** CLI is the primary user interface. Testing ensures proper parameter passing and user experience.

### 4. Backup Orchestrator Integration (Medium Priority)

**Missing Tests:**

- Repository name parameter passing to repository factory
- Integration with per-repository credential system
- Error handling when repository creation fails

**Rationale:** Ensures backup operations work correctly with per-repository credentials.

## Recommended Test Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Security & Core Functionality

1. **CredentialManager per-repository methods** - Test storage, retrieval, and encryption
2. **S3ResticRepository credential resolution** - Test the credential chain fallback
3. **CLI credential commands** - Test user-facing credential management

### Phase 2: Integration & Error Handling

4. **CLI repository name passing** - Test parameter flow through backup commands
5. **S3 repository environment setup** - Test endpoint and TLS configuration
6. **Repository initialization** - Test with stored credentials

### Phase 3: Edge Cases & Performance

7. **Error handling scenarios** - Test credential manager locked, network failures
8. **Validation improvements** - Test lightweight validation without network calls
9. **Backup orchestrator integration** - Test repository factory parameter passing

## Specific Test Suggestions

### Unit Tests Needed:

- `CredentialManager.store_repository_backend_credentials()` with S3/B2 credentials
- `S3ResticRepository` credential resolution chain with mocked credential manager
- `S3ResticRepository.backend_env()` with endpoint and insecure_tls settings
- CLI helper function `store_backend_credentials()` with various scenarios

### Integration Tests Needed:

- End-to-end credential storage and retrieval workflow
- CLI commands with credential manager integration
- Repository initialization using stored credentials
- Backup operations with per-repository credentials

### Security Tests Needed:

- Credential encryption and secure storage
- Audit logging for credential operations
- Access control when credential manager is locked
- Sensitive data not exposed in logs or error messages

## Testing Framework Recommendations

Based on the existing test patterns in the codebase:

- Use `pytest` with appropriate markers (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.security`)
- Mock external dependencies (credential manager, S3 services) for unit tests
- Use temporary directories and cleanup fixtures for integration tests
- Follow existing patterns in `tests/TimeLocker/security/test_credential_manager.py`
- Add tests to appropriate directories: `tests/TimeLocker/cli/`, `tests/TimeLocker/security/`, `tests/TimeLocker/restic/Repositories/`

The suggested tests focus on high-value scenarios that verify critical functionality and catch potential regressions. Priority is given to security-related
features and integration points between components.
