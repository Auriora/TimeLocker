# Process

This document outlines a streamlined Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process designed for a solo developer working with AI assistance (such as GPT LLM AI
like JetBrains Junie). It removes the need for interviews, workshops, and multi-stakeholder activities while maintaining the essential elements of a robust
SDLC.

## Process Overview

The simplified SDLC process consists of the following phases:

1. **Requirements Definition**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

Each phase includes AI-assisted activities and prompts to guide the development process.

## 1. Requirements Definition

This phase focuses on defining clear, concise requirements for the software without the need for stakeholder interviews or workshops.

## 2. Design

This phase focuses on creating a technical and user experience design that satisfies the requirements without the need for user research or stakeholder feedback
sessions.

## 3. Implementation

This phase focuses on developing the software according to the design specifications with AI assistance for coding and problem-solving.

## 4. Testing

This phase focuses on verifying that the software meets the requirements and is free of defects without the need for a dedicated QA team.

## 5. Deployment

This phase focuses on deploying the software to the production environment with minimal disruption.

## 6. Maintenance

This phase focuses on maintaining and improving the software over time based on usage and feedback.

## Adapting the Process

This simplified process can be adapted based on:

- **Project complexity**: Add more detailed activities for complex projects
- **Time constraints**: Focus on essential activities when time is limited
- **Technical requirements**: Add specialized activities for specific technical domains
- **Personal preferences**: Adjust the process to match your working style

Remember that the goal is to maintain software quality while eliminating unnecessary overhead for a solo developer working with AI assistance.
