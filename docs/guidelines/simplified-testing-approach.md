# Testing Approach

A simplified guide to effective testing for solo developers with limited time and resources.

## Core Testing Principles

1. **Test what matters most**: Focus on critical features and high-risk areas
2. **Test early and often**: Catch issues when they're easiest to fix
3. **Automate strategically**: Automate repetitive tests, manually test complex scenarios
4. **Use AI assistance**: Leverage AI to help identify test cases and potential issues
5. **Be pragmatic**: Aim for good coverage, not perfect coverage

## Essential Testing Types

### [Unit Testing](Unit-Testing.md)

Test individual components in isolation. Write tests for complex logic, critical paths, and previous bug fixes.

### [Integration Testing](Integration-Testing.md)

Test how components work together. Focus on key integration points and data flows between modules.

### [Functional Testing](Functional-Testing.md)

Test complete features from a user perspective. Prioritize core user workflows and business-critical functions.

### [UI Testing](Automated-UI-Testing.md)

Selectively automate stable UI flows. Manually test complex interactions and edge cases.

### [Performance Testing](Performance-Testing.md)

Focus on response times for critical operations. Use simple tools to identify bottlenecks.

### [Security Testing](Security-Testing.md)

Check authentication, input validation, and data protection. Use automated scanners for common vulnerabilities.

## Quick-Start Testing Checklist

- [ ] Write unit tests for complex business logic
- [ ] Test critical user workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Verify integrations with external systems
- [ ] Check error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Run automated tests before each commit
- [ ] Perform exploratory testing on new features
- [ ] Use security scanning tools regularly
