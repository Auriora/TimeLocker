## PR #65: Testing CLI Test Suite

**Status:** ‚úÖ Mergeable (conflicts resolved)  
**Review Comments:** 5  
**Detailed Report:** [PR_65_REVIEW_COMMENTS.md](PR_65_REVIEW_COMMENTS.md)

### Summary
Refactored CLI test suite with improvements addressing all review comments from the original PR #58.

### High Priority Issues (2)
1. **Short ID Calculation Safety** - Add length check to prevent IndexError
2. **Code Duplication in Test Files** - Apply refactoring to remaining test files (test_snapshots_commands.py)

### Medium Priority Issues (2)
3. **Mock Service Manager Spec Usage** - Use spec parameters for better mock validation
4. **Snapshot ID Validation Documentation** - Improve test assertions and documentation

### Low Priority Issues (1)
5. **Test Configuration Completeness** - Add missing notification properties

### Recommendation
**Can be merged after addressing high-priority items** - The short ID safety check and remaining code duplication should be fixed before merging.

## PR #64: Per-Repository Credentials Implementation

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Open (needs fixes before merge)  
**Review Comments:** 11  
**Detailed Report:** [PR_64_REVIEW_COMMENTS.md](PR_64_REVIEW_COMMENTS.md)

### Summary
Implements per-repository backend credential management for S3 and B2 repositories with secure storage and CLI commands.

### High Priority Issues (6)
1. **URI Field Lookup Bug** (3 occurrences) - Handle both 'uri' and 'location' fields in credential commands
2. **Code Duplication** (2 occurrences) - Extract AWS and B2 credential storage logic
3. **Bare Except Clause** - Use specific exception types instead of bare except

### Medium Priority Issues (4)
4. **Missing Documentation** (2 occurrences) - Document repository_name parameter in S3 and B2 classes
5. **Performance Optimization** - Consider optimizing credential access tracking
6. **Code Organization** - Simplify nested function complexity

### Recommendation
**Must fix high-priority issues before merging** - The URI field lookup bug is critical and could cause runtime failures. Code duplication should also be addressed.

### Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1 (Critical):** Fix URI field lookup and bare except clause
2. **Phase 2 (Quality):** Extract credential storage logic and add documentation
3. **Phase 3 (Optional):** Consider performance optimization

## PR #59: Per-Repository Credentials Tests

**Status:** üö´ Blocked by PR #64  
**Review Comments:** 10  
**Detailed Report:** [PR_59_REVIEW_COMMENTS.md](PR_59_REVIEW_COMMENTS.md)

### Summary
Comprehensive test coverage for per-repository credential management. Tests were written before implementation (test-first approach).

### Critical Issues (5) - All Blocked by PR #64
1. **Missing has_backend_credentials Field** - Needs implementation from PR #64
2. **Missing store_repository_backend_credentials Method** - Needs implementation from PR #64
3. **Missing get_repository_backend_credentials Method** - Needs implementation from PR #64
4. **Missing repository_name Parameter (S3)** - Needs implementation from PR #64
5. **Missing repository_name Parameter (Factory)** - Needs implementation from PR #64

### Medium Priority Issues (3)
6. **Monkey Patching Approach** - Use pytest fixtures instead of direct patching
7. **Duplicate Monkey Patching** - Extract to reusable fixture
8. **Credential Manager Unlock Verification** - Add explicit verification

### Low Priority Issues (2)
9. **Typo in Docstring** - Simple typo fix
10. **Fixture Return Type** - Improve MinIO availability fixture

### Recommendation
**Wait for PR #64 to be merged first** - This PR contains tests for functionality that doesn't exist yet. After PR #64 is merged, implement test quality improvements (comments #6-10).

PR #64 (Implementation)
    ‚Üì
PR #59 (Tests) - Blocked until #64 is merged
    
PR #65 (CLI Tests) - Independent, can be merged separately
```

## Overall Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **PR #65 - Testing CLI Test Suite**
   - Fix short ID calculation safety check
   - Apply code duplication fixes to remaining test files
   - Can be merged after these fixes

2. **PR #64 - Per-Repository Credentials Implementation**
   - **CRITICAL:** Fix URI field lookup in all three credential commands
   - **CRITICAL:** Fix bare except clause
   - **HIGH:** Extract credential storage logic to eliminate duplication
   - **MEDIUM:** Add documentation for repository_name parameter
   - Should be merged before PR #59

3. **PR #59 - Per-Repository Credentials Tests**
   - **WAIT** for PR #64 to be merged first
   - Then implement test quality improvements (monkey patching, fixtures)
   - Merge after PR #64

### Suggested Merge Order

1. **First:** PR #65 (after fixing high-priority items)
2. **Second:** PR #64 (after fixing all high-priority items)
3. **Third:** PR #59 (after PR #64 is merged and test improvements are made)
