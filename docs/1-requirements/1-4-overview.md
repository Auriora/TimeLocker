# 1.5 Overview

This <tooltip term="SRS">Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</tooltip> document provides a comprehensive and structured description of the **TimeLocker**,
including its functional and non-functional requirements. The document is designed to serve as a key reference point for all stakeholders—developers, quality
assurance engineers, project managers, <tooltip term="UX/UI">UX/UI</tooltip> designers, security teams, and other contributors—throughout the software
development lifecycle.
The primary objective of this <tooltip term="SRS">SRS</tooltip> is to not only specify what the application is meant to accomplish but also define the scope,
constraints, and quality criteria that govern its development. By addressing both the "what" and "how" of the application's functionality, this document ensures
all stakeholders maintain alignment on the project's goals, guiding development efforts and confirming compliance with industry-best practices such
as <tooltip term="GDPR">GDPR</tooltip>, <tooltip term="OWASP-ASVS">OWASP-ASVS</tooltip>, and ISO/IEEE standards.
To facilitate easy navigation and clear understanding, the SRS is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction (Section 1):** Outlines the purpose, intended audience, and scope of this SRS document. This section also establishes clarity and alignment by
   defining key terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used throughout the document.
2. **Overall Description (Section 2):** Provides a high-level perspective of the application, including its architectural context, targeted user base,
   assumptions, dependencies, and any known constraints that could impact development or operation.
3. **Specific Requirements (Section 3):** The core of the document, this section details both functional and non-functional requirements:
    - **Functional Requirements:** Organized into logical categories such as <tooltip term="Repository Management">repository
      management</tooltip>, <tooltip term="Backup Operations">backup operations</tooltip>, recovery operations, <tooltip term="Policy Management">policy
      management</tooltip>, and monitoring/reporting. These requirements outline critical features like <tooltip term="Snapshot">snapshot</tooltip>
      creation, <tooltip term="Retention Policy">retention policy</tooltip> updates, and <tooltip term="Disaster Recovery">disaster recovery</tooltip>
      processes.
    - **Non-functional Requirements:** Specifies performance, reliability, usability, accessibility, scalability, <tooltip term="Security">security</tooltip>,
      and <tooltip term="Auditability">auditability</tooltip> criteria to ensure the application meets operational expectations and complies with defined
      standards.
4. **Use Cases (Section 4):** Links the requirements to real-world scenarios, describing the workflow and actors involved (e.g. <tooltip term="Everyday Users">
   everyday users</tooltip>, <tooltip term="Power Users">power users</tooltip>, and system operations). Each use case highlights specific goals such as
   configuring <tooltip term="Repositories">repositories</tooltip>, <tooltip term="Scheduling Backups">scheduling backups</tooltip>, and
   verifying <tooltip term="Audit Log">audit logs</tooltip>.
5. **Traceability (Section 5):** Contains traceability matrices that map requirements to various standards, regulations, and quality models, ensuring compliance
   with guidelines such as <tooltip term="GDPR">GDPR</tooltip>, <tooltip term="OWASP-ASVS">OWASP-ASVS</tooltip>, and ISO/IEEE standards.
6. **Appendices (Section 6):** Provides supplementary information including glossaries, analysis models, and compliance documentation artifacts.
7. **Document Change Management (Section 7):** Tracks changes to the SRS document over time, including version history, approval process, and version control
   information.

Additionally, appendices further supplement the document with glossaries, analysis models, and compliance documentation artifacts to aid in deeper understanding
and <tooltip term="Auditability">auditability</tooltip>.
