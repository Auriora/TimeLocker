| **Alternative Flows**        | **AF-1 Hardware incompatibility** <br> a. System detects incompatible hardware. <br> b. System warns user and offers options to continue with potential issues or abort. <br><br> **AF-2 Insufficient disk space** <br> a. Target disk lacks space for complete restore. <br> b. System offers options to select different partitions or abort. <br><br> **AF-3 Authentication failure** <br> a. User cannot authenticate to repository. <br> b. System prompts for alternative credentials or repository. <br><br> **AF-4 Partial restore failure** <br> a. Some components fail to restore. <br> b. System logs specific failures, completes what it can, and provides detailed report.                                                             |
| **Special Requirements**     | * Recovery media must be bootable on UEFI and legacy BIOS systems. <br> * System must handle driver differences between source and target hardware. <br> * Progress updates must continue even during lengthy operations. <br> * Recovery process must be resumable after interruption when possible. <br> * System must provide detailed logs of all recovery actions for troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
