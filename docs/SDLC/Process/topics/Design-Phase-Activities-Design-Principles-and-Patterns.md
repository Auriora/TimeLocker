# Design Principles and Patterns
- Apply appropriate design patterns (e.g., MVC, MVVM, Repository) based on application requirements (IEEE 830-1998 Section 3.3; ISO/IEC 25010:2023 Section 4.2)
- Implement separation of concerns to enhance maintainability and testability
- Design for extensibility to accommodate future requirements
- Follow the principle of least privilege for security-sensitive components
