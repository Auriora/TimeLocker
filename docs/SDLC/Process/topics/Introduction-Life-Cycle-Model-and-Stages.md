# Life Cycle Model and Stages
This SDLC follows an iterative and incremental development model, with the following stages:

1. **Inception Stage**: Includes initial requirements gathering and analysis
2. **Elaboration Stage**: Encompasses UX/UI design and detailed technical design
3. **Construction Stage**: Covers implementation/development and testing
4. **Transition Stage**: Includes deployment and initial maintenance
5. **Operations Stage**: Ongoing maintenance and continuous improvement

Each stage may involve multiple iterations, with feedback loops allowing for refinement based on stakeholder input and changing requirements.
