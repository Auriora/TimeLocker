# Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

## Prompt for Architecture Design Document
```
Hi Junie, please produce the Architecture Design Document that defines our system's high-level structure. Include UML diagrams showing major components, their relationships, and integration points with the approved UX/UI designs. Ensure the architecture addresses the quality attributes specified in the SRS (particularly sections on performance, security, and maintainability). Document key architectural decisions and their rationales. Once complete, share this document for my review.
```

## Prompt for Detailed Design Specification
```
Hi Junie, please create a Detailed Design Specification that elaborates on our approved architecture. Include detailed module designs, interface definitions, data structures, and algorithm specifications. Ensure traceability to requirements in the SRS and alignment with our UI style guide. Document error handling strategies and security mechanisms. Once complete, share this document for my review.
```

## Prompt for Design Review
```
Hi Junie, please review the attached design documentation against our requirements and design standards. Evaluate for completeness, consistency, and compliance with our architectural principles. Identify any potential risks, performance bottlenecks, or security vulnerabilities. Suggest improvements where appropriate. Provide your analysis in a structured report format for discussion in our upcoming design review meeting.
