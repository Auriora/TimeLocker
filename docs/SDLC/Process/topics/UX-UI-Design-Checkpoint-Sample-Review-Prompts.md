# Checkpoint & Sample Review Prompts

## For User Research
```
Hi Junie, please analyze the user research data we've collected and create user personas and scenarios for our Desktop GUI application. Ensure that the personas represent our key user groups and that the scenarios cover the primary use cases identified in the SRS. Once complete, share these artifacts for my review.
```

## For UX Artifacts
```
Hi Junie, please create a set of wireframes and user journey maps for the Desktop GUI application, ensuring that the user flows align with the requirements stated in the SRS. Include information architecture diagrams and navigation models. Ensure all designs consider the accessibility requirements in section 3.4.9 of the SRS. Share these UX artifacts so that I can review the proposed user interactions and suggest any tweaks.
```

## For UI Artifacts
```
Hi Junie, please generate high-fidelity UI mockups along with a detailed style guide for our application. The style guide should include color palettes (with accessibility contrast ratios), typography choices, spacing systems, and UI component guidelines. Ensure the designs comply with WCAG 2.2 AA standards as specified in our requirements. Once complete, please present the mockups and style guide for my review and approval.
```

## For Usability Testing
```
Hi Junie, please create a usability test plan for our application design. Include test scenarios, tasks, metrics for evaluation, and participant recruitment criteria. Ensure the test covers the key user journeys and focuses on validating both the functional requirements and the usability requirements specified in the SRS. Once complete, share the test plan for my review before we proceed with testing.
