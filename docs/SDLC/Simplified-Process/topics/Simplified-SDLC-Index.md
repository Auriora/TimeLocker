# Guide

This document serves as an index and guide to the simplified Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process designed specifically for solo developers working with AI assistance (such as GPT LLM AI like JetBrains Junie). The process removes the need for interviews, workshops, and multi-stakeholder activities while maintaining the essential elements of a robust SDLC.

## Overview

Traditional SDLC processes are designed for teams with multiple roles and stakeholders. This simplified approach adapts those processes for a solo developer context, leveraging AI assistance to compensate for limited human resources.

### Key Benefits

- **Streamlined Process**: Eliminates unnecessary overhead while maintaining quality
- **AI Integration**: Leverages AI capabilities throughout the development lifecycle
- **Practical Guidance**: Provides specific prompts and techniques for each phase
- **Flexible Adaptation**: Can be tailored to different project types and personal preferences
- **Quality Focus**: Maintains essential quality practices despite limited resources

## Process Components

The simplified SDLC consists of the following components, each with its own detailed documentation:

1. **[Simplified SDLC Process](Simplified-SDLC-Process.md)**: The overall process framework
2. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**: Comprehensive requirements documentation
3. **[Simplified UX/UI Design Guide](Simplified-UX-UI-Design-Guide.md)**: Streamlined approach to design
4. **[Simplified Testing Approach](Simplified-Testing-Approach.md)**: Testing strategies for solo developers

## How to Use This Process

### Getting Started

1. Begin by reviewing the [Simplified SDLC Process](Simplified-SDLC-Process.md) document to understand the overall framework
2. For each phase of your project, refer to the corresponding detailed document
3. Use the AI prompts provided in each document to get assistance at each step
4. Adapt the process to fit your specific project needs and personal workflow

### Process Flow

The simplified SDLC follows this general flow:

1. **Requirements Definition**
   - Document your own needs and goals
   - Use AI to help identify and refine requirements
   - Use the comprehensive SRS documentation in the Writerside docs/SDLC/SRS
   - Prioritize requirements based on value and feasibility

2. **Design**
   - Create a technical architecture with AI assistance
   - Develop simplified UX/UI designs following the guide
   - Design data models and APIs
   - Document key design decisions

3. **Implementation**
   - Develop code with AI assistance for problem-solving
   - Follow good coding practices and organization
   - Document as you go
   - Use version control effectively

4. **Testing**
   - Follow the simplified testing approach
   - Focus on high-risk and high-value areas
   - Use AI to help identify test cases and potential issues
   - Automate where possible

5. **Deployment**
   - Plan and execute deployment with minimal complexity
   - Verify deployment success
   - Monitor for issues

6. **Maintenance**
   - Address bugs and implement enhancements
   - Use AI to help diagnose and fix issues
   - Update documentation as needed

## AI Assistance Strategy

To effectively use AI assistance throughout this process:

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context when asking for AI assistance
2. **Iterate**: Refine AI outputs through follow-up questions
3. **Verify**: Always review and validate AI suggestions
4. **Learn**: Use AI explanations to build your own understanding
5. **Combine Approaches**: Use AI alongside your own expertise and judgment

### Example AI Interaction Flow

1. **Initial Query**: "Based on this project description, what functional requirements should I consider?"
2. **Follow-up**: "Can you help me prioritize these requirements using the MoSCoW method?"
3. **Refinement**: "For this specific requirement, what edge cases should I consider?"
4. **Implementation**: "Help me design a class structure to implement this requirement."
5. **Validation**: "Review this implementation for potential issues or improvements."

## Adapting the Process

This simplified SDLC can be adapted based on:

- **Project Size**: For very small projects, further simplify documentation
- **Technical Domain**: Add domain-specific activities for specialized areas
- **Personal Preferences**: Adjust to match your working style and strengths
- **Time Constraints**: Focus on the most critical elements when time is limited

Remember that the goal is to maintain software quality while eliminating unnecessary overhead for a solo developer working with AI assistance.

## Document Maintenance

As you use this process, you may identify improvements or adaptations that work better for your specific context. Feel free to:

1. Update these documents with your own insights
2. Add new templates or guides for specific needs
3. Refine the AI prompts based on what works best
4. Share your improvements with the community

## Getting Help

If you encounter challenges while using this process:

1. Review the detailed documentation for the specific phase
2. Use the AI prompts provided to get assistance
3. Adapt the process as needed for your specific situation
4. Remember that the process serves you, not the other way around
