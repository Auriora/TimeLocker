# Security Testing

Security testing verifies that software is protected against vulnerabilities and threats. Focus on essential security measures to protect users and data without specialized expertise.

## Why It Matters

For solo developers, security testing:
- Protects sensitive user data
- Maintains user trust and reputation
- Reduces legal liability
- Prevents exploitation by attackers
- Saves costs by finding issues early

## Key Security Areas to Test

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify identity confirmation and access controls
2. **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
3. **Data Protection**: Check that sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
4. **Session Management**: Test that user sessions are securely handled
5. **Error Handling**: Ensure errors don't expose sensitive information

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Adopt a security mindset**:
   - Think like an attacker
   - Identify sensitive data and operations
   - Use the OWASP Top 10 as a reference

2. **Implement automated scanning**:
   ```bash
   # For Python projects
   pip install bandit
   bandit -r ./my_project

   # For JavaScript projects
   npm audit
   ```

3. **Perform essential manual tests**:
   - Try SQL injection in search fields
   - Attempt to access resources without proper authentication
   - Check for secure HTTP headers
   - Verify proper TLS/SSL configuration

## Example Security Test

```python
def test_password_security():
    # Arrange
    password = "SecurePassword123"
    user_service = UserService()

    # Act
    user = user_service.create_user("testuser", password)

    # Assert
    assert user.password != password  # Not stored as plaintext
    assert user.password.startswith("$2b$")  # Properly hashed
```

## Common Vulnerabilities to Check

- **Injection attacks**: SQL, command, and cross-site scripting
- **Authentication weaknesses**: Weak passwords, missing brute force protection
- **Access control issues**: Unauthorized access to functions or data
- **Sensitive data exposure**: Unencrypted data, insecure transmission

## Recommended Tools

- **OWASP ZAP**: Free web application security scanner
- **SonarQube/Bandit/ESLint**: Code analysis for security issues
- **Mozilla Observatory**: Tests website security configurations
- **SSL Labs**: Verifies proper TLS/SSL setup

## Practical Tips

- Start with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Integrate security scanners into your CI/CD pipeline
- Test security continuously, not just before release
- Use security checklists to ensure consistency
- Learn from security issues in similar applications
