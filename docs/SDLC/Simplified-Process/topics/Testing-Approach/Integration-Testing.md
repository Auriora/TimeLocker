# Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly. They ensure interfaces function properly and data flows correctly through the system.

## Why It Matters

For solo developers, integration testing:
- Catches interface issues between components
- Validates that the system works as a whole
- Identifies problems unit tests might miss
- Verifies interactions with external dependencies
- Builds confidence in end-to-end functionality

## Key Integration Points to Test

- **Component interfaces**: How modules interact within your application
- **API interactions**: Calls to external services and APIs
- **Database operations**: Data storage and retrieval
- **File system interactions**: Reading and writing files
- **Message processing**: Queue and event handling

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Identify critical paths**:
   - Core business workflows
   - High-traffic routes
   - Data-sensitive operations
   - Recently changed interfaces

2. **Choose your approach**:
   - **Bottom-up**: Start with lower-level components (easier debugging)
   - **Top-down**: Start with user-facing functionality (earlier validation)
   - **Hybrid**: Combine approaches based on project needs

3. **Handle dependencies wisely**:
   - Mock external services when appropriate
   - Use real dependencies for critical integrations
   - Consider test containers for database testing

## Example Test

```python
def test_user_registration_flow():
    # Arrange
    email = "test@example.com"
    user_service = UserService(
        user_repository=UserRepository(),
        email_service=MockEmailService()
    )

    # Act
    user = user_service.register_user(email, "securePassword123")

    # Assert
    assert user.id is not None
    assert user.email == email
    assert user_service.email_service.sent_verification_email_to == email
```

## Practical Tips

- Start with the most critical integration points
- Make tests repeatable with automated setup/teardown
- Use realistic test data that covers edge cases
- Run integration tests in CI/CD pipelines
- Keep tests reasonably fast to encourage frequent runs
- Balance mocking (don't mock everything)
- Ensure test environments are similar to production

## Common Pitfalls

- Inconsistent test environments
- Flaky tests that fail intermittently
- Over-mocking that doesn't test real integrations
- Slow tests that discourage running them
- Tests that interfere with each other
