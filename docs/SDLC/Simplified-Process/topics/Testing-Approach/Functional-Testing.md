# Functional Testing

Functional testing verifies that software meets requirements and behaves as expected from the user's perspective. It focuses on testing complete features or workflows.

## Why It Matters

For solo developers, functional testing:
- Validates that your software meets requirements
- Catches user-facing issues early
- Builds confidence in your implementation
- Documents how features should work
- Makes refactoring safer

## Key Testing Types

1. **Smoke Testing**: Quick checks of critical functions
   - Run after each build to catch major issues

2. **Regression Testing**: Ensures changes don't break existing functionality
   - Focus on areas affected by recent changes
   - Automate common regression scenarios

3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Verifies software meets user expectations
   - Test as if you were the end user
   - Validate against original requirements

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Focus on key workflows**:
   - Critical business processes
   - Common user journeys
   - Revenue-generating features

2. **Test both happy paths and edge cases**:
   - Normal user behavior
   - Error conditions and recovery
   - Boundary conditions
   - Security constraints

3. **Consider using BDD** (Behavior-Driven Development):
   ```gherkin
   Feature: Shopping Cart
     Scenario: Adding a product
       Given a user is browsing products
       When they click "Add to Cart" on a product
       Then the product appears in their cart
       And the cart total is updated correctly
   ```

## Example Test

```python
def test_checkout_process():
    # Setup
    user = create_test_user()
    product = create_test_product(price=29.99)
    login_as(user)

    # Execute
    add_to_cart(product)
    proceed_to_checkout()
    enter_payment_details("4111111111111111", "12/25", "123")
    complete_purchase()

    # Verify
    order = get_latest_order_for_user(user)
    assert order.status == "confirmed"
    assert order.total == 29.99
    assert email_was_sent_to(user.email, subject="Order Confirmation")
```

## Test Data Management

- Create reusable test fixtures for common scenarios
- Use database transactions to roll back changes
- Consider separate test databases for isolation

## Recommended Tools

- **General purpose**: pytest, JUnit
- **BDD frameworks**: Cucumber, Behave
- **API testing**: Postman, REST Assured
- **Web testing**: Cypress, Playwright

## Common Pitfalls

- **Unclear objectives**: Define what you're testing and why
- **Brittle tests**: Create tests resilient to minor UI changes
- **Missing negative tests**: Test error conditions and invalid inputs
- **Test interdependence**: Each test should run independently

## Practical Tips

- Start with critical user workflows
- Automate stable, frequently used features first
- Use realistic test data
- Document test cases for complex features
- Balance manual and automated testing
