# Test Documentation

Test documentation captures testing activities, plans, and results. For solo developers, focus on minimal but sufficient documentation that provides value without creating overhead.

## Why It Matters

For solo developers, strategic test documentation:
- Preserves knowledge for your future self
- Provides structure for testing activities
- Shows evidence of quality for stakeholders
- Ensures consistency in critical test areas

However, excessive documentation wastes time, so be selective.

## Essential Documentation Types

### 1. Test Plan (Brief)

A simple outline of what to test, focusing on:
- Scope (what will and won't be tested)
- High-risk areas that need thorough testing
- Testing approach for critical features
- Exit criteria for considering testing complete

### 2. Test Cases (Selective)

Document test cases only for:
- Critical functionality
- Complex features
- Areas prone to regression
- Edge cases and error conditions

### 3. Test Results (Minimal)

Record only essential information:
- Pass/fail status for critical tests
- Issues found during testing
- Evidence for important test results (screenshots)

### 4. Defect Tracking

Use a simple system (GitHub Issues, Trello) to track:
- Bug description and severity
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior

## Simplified Templates

### Mini Test Plan

```markdown
# Test Plan: [Feature Name]

## Scope
- Testing: [key features to test]
- Not testing: [out of scope items]

## Risk Areas
- High: [list with brief rationale]
- Medium: [list with brief rationale]

## Approach
- Critical path testing: [approach]
- Edge cases: [approach]

## Exit Criteria
- [conditions to consider testing complete]
```

### Concise Test Case

```markdown
# Test: [Brief Description]

## Setup
- [required preconditions]

## Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Expected Result
- [what should happen]
```

### Simple Bug Report

```markdown
# Bug: [Brief Description]

## Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

## Expected vs Actual
- Expected: [what should happen]
- Actual: [what actually happens]

## Evidence
[screenshot or log excerpt]
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation as Code

- Store docs in the same repository as code
- Use Markdown for easy maintenance
- Include documentation in code reviews
- Keep docs close to the code they describe

### Living Documentation

- Generate test reports automatically when possible
- Extract test cases from code comments
- Consider BDD frameworks for executable specifications
- Update docs as part of your development workflow

## Practical Tips

- Document only what adds value
- Focus on what will be useful to your future self
- Update documentation incrementally
- Use screenshots instead of lengthy descriptions
- Automate documentation generation where possible
- Avoid duplicating information
