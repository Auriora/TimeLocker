# Simplified SDLC Process for Solo Developer with AI Assistance

This document outlines a streamlined Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process designed for a solo developer working with AI assistance (such as GPT LLM AI like JetBrains Junie). It removes the need for interviews, workshops, and multi-stakeholder activities while maintaining the essential elements of a robust SDLC.

## Process Overview

The simplified SDLC process consists of the following phases:

1. **Requirements Definition**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

Each phase includes AI-assisted activities and prompts to guide the development process.

## 1. Requirements Definition

### Objective
Define clear, concise requirements for the software without the need for stakeholder interviews or workshops.

### Activities
- **Self-reflection on needs**: Document your own needs and goals for the software
- **AI-assisted requirements elicitation**: Use AI to help identify additional requirements
- **Requirements prioritization**: Categorize requirements as must-have, should-have, could-have, won't-have
- **Requirements documentation**: Create a simplified SRS document

### AI Prompts for Requirements Definition
- "Based on the project description, what are the essential functional requirements we should consider?"
- "What non-functional requirements are critical for this type of application?"
- "Help me prioritize these requirements based on technical feasibility and value."
- "What edge cases or potential issues should I consider for these requirements?"
- "Generate a simplified SRS template for a solo developer project."

### Documentation Produced
- Simplified Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Requirements prioritization matrix

## 2. Design

### Objective
Create a technical and user experience design that satisfies the requirements without the need for user research or stakeholder feedback sessions.

### Activities
- **AI-assisted architecture design**: Use AI to help design the system architecture
- **Simplified UX/UI design**: Create basic wireframes and user flows
- **Data model design**: Define data structures and relationships
- **API design**: Define interfaces between components

### AI Prompts for Design
- "Based on these requirements, what architecture would you recommend for this project?"
- "Help me design a simple and intuitive user interface for this feature."
- "What data model would best support these requirements?"
- "Generate a class diagram for this component based on our requirements."
- "What design patterns would be appropriate for this scenario?"

### Documentation Produced
- System architecture diagram
- Basic wireframes or UI mockups
- Data model diagram
- API specifications

## 3. Implementation

### Objective
Develop the software according to the design specifications with AI assistance for coding and problem-solving.

### Activities
- **AI-assisted coding**: Use AI to generate code snippets and solve coding problems
- **Code organization**: Structure code according to the design
- **Documentation**: Document code as it's written
- **Version control**: Maintain a clean commit history

### AI Prompts for Implementation
- "Generate a code snippet for implementing this feature according to our design."
- "How can I optimize this code for better performance?"
- "Help me debug this issue I'm encountering."
- "What test cases should I write for this function?"
- "Review this code for potential security vulnerabilities."

### Documentation Produced
- Source code with comments
- README and other developer documentation
- API documentation

## 4. Testing

### Objective
Verify that the software meets the requirements and is free of defects without the need for a dedicated QA team.

### Activities
- **AI-assisted test planning**: Use AI to help identify test cases
- **Unit testing**: Test individual components
- **Integration testing**: Test component interactions
- **System testing**: Test the entire system
- **Performance testing**: Verify performance requirements

### AI Prompts for Testing
- "What test cases should I include for this feature?"
- "Help me write unit tests for this class."
- "What edge cases should I test for this functionality?"
- "How can I test the performance of this component?"
- "Review my test coverage and suggest improvements."

### Documentation Produced
- Test plan
- Test cases
- Test results

## 5. Deployment

### Objective
Deploy the software to the production environment with minimal disruption.

### Activities
- **Deployment planning**: Plan the deployment process
- **Environment setup**: Prepare the production environment
- **Deployment execution**: Deploy the software
- **Verification**: Verify the deployment was successful

### AI Prompts for Deployment
- "What steps should I include in my deployment plan?"
- "Help me create a checklist for pre-deployment verification."
- "What monitoring should I set up for the production environment?"
- "What rollback procedures should I have in place?"

### Documentation Produced
- Deployment plan
- Production environment configuration
- Deployment checklist

## 6. Maintenance

### Objective
Maintain and improve the software over time based on usage and feedback.

### Activities
- **Bug fixing**: Address issues as they arise
- **Feature enhancement**: Implement new features
- **Performance optimization**: Improve performance
- **Security updates**: Address security vulnerabilities

### AI Prompts for Maintenance
- "Help me diagnose and fix this bug."
- "How can I implement this new feature with minimal changes to the existing code?"
- "What performance optimizations can I make to this component?"
- "Are there any security vulnerabilities in this code that need to be addressed?"

### Documentation Produced
- Updated documentation
- Release notes
- Maintenance log

## Adapting the Process

This simplified process can be adapted based on:

- **Project complexity**: Add more detailed activities for complex projects
- **Time constraints**: Focus on essential activities when time is limited
- **Technical requirements**: Add specialized activities for specific technical domains
- **Personal preferences**: Adjust the process to match your working style

Remember that the goal is to maintain software quality while eliminating unnecessary overhead for a solo developer working with AI assistance.
