# Simplified SRS Template for Solo Developer with AI Assistance

This document provides a streamlined Software Requirements Specification (SRS) template designed for a solo developer working with AI assistance. It maintains the essential elements of a comprehensive SRS while eliminating components that require multiple stakeholders or extensive user research.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Brief statement of the purpose of the system and this SRS document.

### 1.2 Scope
Description of what the software will and will not do.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
List of terms, definitions, and acronyms used in the document.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
How the product fits into the larger ecosystem or relates to existing systems.

### 2.2 Product Functions
High-level summary of the major functions the software will perform.

### 2.3 Constraints
Technical, regulatory, or business constraints that limit development options.

### 2.4 Assumptions
Factors assumed to be true that affect the requirements.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 [Functional Area 1]
- **FR-1.1**: [Requirement description]
- **FR-1.2**: [Requirement description]

#### 3.1.2 [Functional Area 2]
- **FR-2.1**: [Requirement description]
- **FR-2.2**: [Requirement description]

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance
- **NFR-P.1**: [Performance requirement]

#### 3.2.2 Security
- **NFR-S.1**: [Security requirement]

#### 3.2.3 Usability
- **NFR-U.1**: [Usability requirement]

#### 3.2.4 Reliability
- **NFR-R.1**: [Reliability requirement]

#### 3.2.5 Maintainability
- **NFR-M.1**: [Maintainability requirement]

## 4. Simplified Use Cases

### 4.1 [Use Case 1]

**ID**: UC-001  
**Name**: [Use Case Name]  
**Description**: [Brief description]  
**Primary Actor**: [Usually the solo developer or end user]  
**Preconditions**: [Conditions that must be true before the use case begins]  
**Basic Flow**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Alternative Flows**:
- [Alternative flow 1]
- [Alternative flow 2]

**Postconditions**: [Conditions that must be true after the use case completes]

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 Entity Relationship Diagram
[Placeholder for ER diagram or description]

### 5.2 Data Dictionary
[List of data entities and their attributes]

## 6. External Interfaces

### 6.1 User Interfaces
Description of the user interfaces, including mockups if available.

### 6.2 APIs and External Systems
Description of interfaces to external systems or APIs.

## 7. Prioritization Matrix

| Requirement ID | Priority (MoSCoW) | Complexity (1-5) | Value (1-5) | Implementation Order |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| FR-1.1         | Must Have         | 2                | 5           | 1                    |
| FR-1.2         | Should Have       | 3                | 4           | 2                    |
| NFR-P.1        | Could Have        | 4                | 3           | 3                    |

## AI Assistance Prompts for SRS Development

Use these prompts with your AI assistant to help develop and refine your SRS:

- "Based on the project description, what functional requirements should I include?"
- "What non-functional requirements are critical for this type of application?"
- "Help me prioritize these requirements using the MoSCoW method."
- "What use cases should I document for this feature?"
- "What data entities and attributes should be included in the data model?"
- "What external interfaces should I consider for this system?"
- "Are there any requirements I've overlooked for this type of application?"
- "Help me identify potential conflicts or dependencies between these requirements."
- "What acceptance criteria should I include for this requirement?"
- "How can I make this requirement more specific and measurable?"

## Notes for Solo Development

- Focus on requirements that provide the most value first
- Use AI to help identify edge cases and potential issues
- Revisit and update the SRS as development progresses
- Document assumptions clearly as they often become requirements
- For solo projects, it's acceptable to combine or simplify sections as needed
- Use the SRS as a living document that evolves with the project
