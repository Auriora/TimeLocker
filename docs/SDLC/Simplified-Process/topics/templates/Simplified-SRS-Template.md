# SRS Template

This document provides a streamlined Software Requirements Specification (SRS) template designed for a solo developer working with AI assistance. It maintains the essential elements of a comprehensive SRS while eliminating components that require multiple stakeholders or extensive user research.

## 1. Introduction

This section provides an introduction to the software system and the SRS document.

## 2. Overall Description

This section provides a high-level overview of the software system, its context, and major functions.

## 3. Specific Requirements

This section details the specific functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

## 4. Simplified Use Cases

This section describes the key use cases for the system, focusing on user interactions and expected outcomes.

## 5. Data Model

This section describes the data structures and relationships used in the system.

## 6. External Interfaces

This section describes the interfaces between the system and external entities, including user interfaces and APIs.

## 7. Prioritization Matrix

This section provides a framework for prioritizing requirements based on their importance, complexity, and value.

## AI Assistance Prompts for SRS Development

Use these prompts with your AI assistant to help develop and refine your SRS:

- "Based on the project description, what functional requirements should I include?"
- "What non-functional requirements are critical for this type of application?"
- "Help me prioritize these requirements using the MoSCoW method."
- "What use cases should I document for this feature?"
- "What data entities and attributes should be included in the data model?"
- "What external interfaces should I consider for this system?"
- "Are there any requirements I've overlooked for this type of application?"
- "Help me identify potential conflicts or dependencies between these requirements."
- "What acceptance criteria should I include for this requirement?"
- "How can I make this requirement more specific and measurable?"

## Notes for Solo Development

- Focus on requirements that provide the most value first
- Use AI to help identify edge cases and potential issues
- Revisit and update the SRS as development progresses
- Document assumptions clearly as they often become requirements
- For solo projects, it's acceptable to combine or simplify sections as needed
- Use the SRS as a living document that evolves with the project
