# 1. Requirements Definition

## Objective
Define clear, concise requirements for the software without the need for stakeholder interviews or workshops.

## Activities
- **Self-reflection on needs**: Document your own needs and goals for the software
- **AI-assisted requirements elicitation**: Use AI to help identify additional requirements
- **Requirements prioritization**: Categorize requirements as must-have, should-have, could-have, won't-have
- **Requirements documentation**: Create a simplified SRS document

## AI Prompts for Requirements Definition
- "Based on the project description, what are the essential functional requirements we should consider?"
- "What non-functional requirements are critical for this type of application?"
- "Help me prioritize these requirements based on technical feasibility and value."
- "What edge cases or potential issues should I consider for these requirements?"
- "Generate a simplified SRS template for a solo developer project."

## Documentation Produced
- [Simplified Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](Simplified-SRS-Template.md)
- [Requirements prioritization matrix](Simplified-SRS-Prioritization-Matrix.md)
