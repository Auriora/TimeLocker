# 2. Design

## Objective
Create a technical and user experience design that satisfies the requirements without the need for user research or stakeholder feedback sessions.

## Activities
- **Architecture design**: Use AI to help design the system architecture
- **Component breakdown**: Create diagrams showing system component relationships and interactions
- **Simplified UX/UI design**: Create basic wireframes and user flows with detailed UX flow descriptions
- **Data model design**: Define data structures and relationships
- **API design**: Define interfaces between components using OpenAPI specifications

## AI Prompts for Design
- "Based on these requirements, what architecture would you recommend for this project?"
- "Help me design a simple and intuitive user interface for this feature."
- "Create a detailed UX flow diagram for this user journey."
- "What data model would best support these requirements?"
- "Generate a class diagram for this component based on our requirements."
- "Create a component break-down diagram showing the relationships between system components."
- "What design patterns would be appropriate for this scenario?"
- "Help me define OpenAPI specifications for these API endpoints."

## Documentation Produced
- System architecture diagram
- Component break-down diagram
- [UX flow diagrams and descriptions](UXFlow-Template.md)
- Basic wireframes or UI mockups
- Data model diagram
- [API specifications using OpenAPI standard](https://www.openapis.org/)
