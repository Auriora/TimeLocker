# Related Flows

This document provides an overview of the additional user flows in the TimeLocker application that support and enhance the core functionality. These related
flows enable users to manage specific aspects of the backup system in detail.

## Overview

The related flows of TimeLocker include:

1. **Repository Management Flow**: Adding, editing, and removing backup repositories
2. **Pattern Group Management Flow**: Creating and managing file inclusion/exclusion patterns
3. **Scheduled Task Management Flow**: Configuring and monitoring automated backup schedules
4. **Log Analysis Flow**: Reviewing and exporting operation logs
5. **Settings Management Flow**: Configuring application-wide settings

These flows provide more specialized functionality that supports the core backup and restore operations.

## Repository Management Flow

The [Repository Management Flow](repository-management-flow.md) allows users to:

- Add new backup repositories of different types (local, SFTP, S3, etc.)
- Edit existing repository configurations
- Test repository connections
- Remove repositories that are no longer needed
- View repository status and statistics

This flow is critical for users who need to manage multiple backup destinations or change where their backups are stored.

## Pattern Group Management Flow

The [Pattern Group Management Flow](pattern-group-management-flow.md) enables users to:

- Create named groups of file inclusion/exclusion patterns
- Test patterns against sample file paths
- Edit existing pattern groups
- Apply pattern groups to backup configurations
- Import/export pattern groups for sharing

This flow helps users precisely control which files are included in or excluded from their backups.

## Scheduled Task Management Flow

The [Scheduled Task Management Flow](scheduled-task-management-flow.md) allows users to:

- Create new backup schedules with various frequencies
- Set conditions for when backups should run
- Edit existing schedules
- Enable/disable scheduled backups
- View schedule history and statistics

This flow ensures that backups run automatically at appropriate times without user intervention.

## Log Analysis Flow

The [Log Analysis Flow](log-analysis-flow.md) enables users to:

- View detailed logs of all backup and restore operations
- Filter logs by various criteria (date, type, status, etc.)
- Search for specific events or messages
- Export logs for external analysis or record-keeping
- Configure log retention settings

This flow is particularly important for troubleshooting issues and maintaining audit records.

## Settings Management Flow

The [Settings Management Flow](settings-management-flow.md) allows users to:

- Configure application-wide preferences
- Manage security settings
- Set default behaviors for various operations
- Customize the user interface
- Import/export application settings

This flow enables users to tailor the application to their specific needs and preferences.

## Flow Relationships

These related flows interact with the core flows and with each other in the following ways:

- **Repository Management** is used during Initial Setup and can be accessed from Backup Management
- **Pattern Group Management** is used when configuring backups in both Initial Setup and Backup Management
- **Scheduled Task Management** is configured during Initial Setup and can be modified from Backup Management
- **Log Analysis** is accessible from any flow and provides information about all operations
- **Settings Management** affects the behavior of all other flows

## User Considerations

Different user personas will interact with these related flows in different ways:

### Everyday Users (Sarah)

- May rarely need to access these flows beyond initial setup
- Will benefit from simplified views of these complex functions
- Should be guided when they do need to use these flows

### Power Users (Michael)

- Will frequently use these flows to customize and optimize their backup system
- Needs access to all advanced options and detailed information
- May create complex configurations using these flows

### Business Users (Elena)

- Will focus on Repository Management and Scheduled Task Management for business continuity
- Needs Log Analysis for compliance and auditing purposes
- May delegate detailed configuration to IT staff

## Navigation

Users can access these related flows through:

- The main application menu
- Context-sensitive buttons in the dashboard
- Direct links from relevant sections of the core flows
- Quick access shortcuts for power users

Each flow provides clear navigation paths back to the main dashboard and to other related flows when appropriate.
