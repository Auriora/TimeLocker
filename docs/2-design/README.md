## Design Principles

### Core Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize user experience and accessibility
2. **Security by Design**: Integrate security considerations throughout the architecture
3. **Scalability**: Design for growth and performance
4. **Maintainability**: Ensure code and architecture are maintainable
5. **Modularity**: Use modular design patterns for flexibility

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Modern web technologies (React/Vue.js)
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, PostgreSQL for enterprise
- **Backup Engine**: Restic CLI integration
- **Security**: Industry-standard encryption and authentication
