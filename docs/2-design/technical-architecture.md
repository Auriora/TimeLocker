## Introduction

The TimeLocker architecture is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and secure backup solution that meets the requirements specified in the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS). The architecture follows a layered approach, with clear separation of concerns between user interfaces, core services,
infrastructure, and storage backends.

Each section of this document explores a different aspect of the architecture, from high-level overview to detailed component descriptions and future plans. For
a complete understanding of the TimeLocker system, it is recommended to review all sections.
