# TimeLocker Project Tracking

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the TimeLocker project's current status, tracking metrics, and development progress.

## Project Status Overview

TimeLocker is a high-level Python interface for backup operations, primarily using the Restic backup tool. The project is currently in the early development
stages, with the following status:

| Phase                   | Status      | Completion |
|-------------------------|-------------|:----------:|
| Requirements Definition | Complete    |    100%    |
| Design                  | Complete    |    100%    |
| Implementation          | Not Started |     0%     |
| Testing                 | Not Started |     0%     |
| Deployment              | Not Started |     0%     |
| Maintenance             | Not Started |     0%     |

## Requirements Traceability

The [Requirements Traceability Matrix](Requirements-Traceability-Matrix.md) provides a comprehensive mapping of requirements to their implementation and test
coverage. Key metrics:

- **Total Requirements**: 25 (17 functional, 8 non-functional)
- **Implementation Status**:
    - Complete: 1 (4%)
    - Partial: 14 (56%)
    - Incomplete: 10 (40%)
- **Major Gaps**:
    - Design documentation is missing
    - Many requirements lack implementation components
    - Insufficient test coverage, especially for non-functional requirements
    - UI implementation is incomplete

## Development Process

The project follows a [Simplified SDLC Process](simplified-process-checklist.md) tailored for solo developers with AI assistance. Current progress:

- **Requirements Definition**: Completed
    - Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documented
    - Requirements prioritization matrix created
- **Design**: Complete
    - Technical architecture documentation created
    - UX/UI design mockups created
    - Data model documentation created
    - API specifications created
- **Implementation**: Not Started
- **Testing**: Not Started
- **Deployment**: Not Started
- **Maintenance**: Not Started

## Roadmap and Future Development

The [project roadmap](ROADMAP.md) outlines planned features and enhancements, including:

- **Plug-in Architecture**:
    - Repository types
    - Backup target selection
    - Plugin marketplace
- **Expanded Backup Targets**:
    - Database backup (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
    - Container and virtualization backup
    - System configuration backup
    - Cloud services backup (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
    - Mobile device backup
- **Advanced Features**:
    - Intelligent backup management with anomaly detection
    - Enhanced security features
    - Performance optimization
    - Extensibility and integration capabilities

## Key Challenges and Risks

Based on the current project status, the following challenges and risks have been identified:

1. **Design Documentation Gap**: Lack of formal design documents creates a traceability gap between requirements and implementation
2. **Implementation Gaps**: Several key requirements lack implementation components
3. **Test Coverage**: Insufficient test coverage, especially for non-functional requirements
4. **UI Implementation**: Requirements related to UI functionality have acceptance tests but no clear implementation components

## Next Steps

The immediate priorities for the project are:

1. Begin implementation with focus on core functionality:
    - Repository management
    - Basic backup operations
    - Security features
2. Develop comprehensive test plan and test cases
3. Implement automated testing framework
4. Prepare for deployment

## Conclusion

The TimeLocker project has established a solid foundation with comprehensive requirements and design documentation. The design phase is now complete with
technical architecture, UX/UI mockups, data models, and API specifications in place. The next phase will focus on implementation of core functionality,
following the simplified SDLC process and addressing the identified gaps in the requirements traceability.
