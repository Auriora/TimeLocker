# 2  Overall Description

# 
This section provides a high-level summary of the **Desktop Backup Application (DBA)**, describing its purpose, functionality, and interactions with its environment. This section outlines the product’s role as a standalone desktop application that integrates the **Restic CLI** with an enhanced graphical user interface, making complex backup and restore operations accessible to both technical and non-technical users. It highlights how the application bridges the gap between a powerful command-line tool and the need for simplicity, reliability, and usability in managing personal or small business backups.

Additionally, this section defines the context in which the DBA operates, including its interaction with local file systems, network storage services (e.g., S3, SFTP, SMB), and external tools through features like API-based integration. By capturing the key characteristics of the application’s target users, environmental constraints, and assumptions, this section establishes the foundational understanding necessary for diving into the product’s requirements and functionalities in subsequent sections. It positions the DBA as both a solution to current user frustrations with manual backups and an opportunity to enhance data security and recovery processes.
