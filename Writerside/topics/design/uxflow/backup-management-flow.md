# Backup Management Flow

This document details the Backup Management Flow for the TimeLocker application, which allows users to view, monitor, and modify their existing backup configurations.

## Flow Objective

The Backup Management Flow aims to:
- Provide clear visibility into backup status and history
- Enable easy modification of backup configurations
- Allow users to initiate manual backups
- Present relevant metrics and statistics
- Alert users to potential issues or optimizations

## Entry Points

Users enter this flow when:
- Completing the initial setup process
- Opening the application after setup has been completed
- Navigating to the dashboard from other sections
- Clicking on backup status notifications

## Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor | Action | System Response | UI Elements | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | User | Views dashboard | System displays backup status overview | Dashboard with status cards | Visual indicators show backup health at a glance |
| 2 | User | Selects a backup target | System displays detailed information for that target | Backup detail panel | Shows last backup time, next scheduled backup, and status |
| 3 | User | Selects "Run Backup Now" | System initiates manual backup | Progress indicator, status updates | Shows real-time progress with option to minimize to background |
| 4 | System | Completes backup | System updates status and notifies user | Success notification, updated status | Notification can be clicked to view details |
| 5 | User | Selects "Edit Backup" | System displays editable backup settings | Settings form with current values | Grouped into basic and advanced sections |
| 6 | User | Modifies settings | System validates changes | Form validation feedback | Prevents invalid configurations |
| 7 | User | Saves changes | System updates configuration | Confirmation message, updated status | Clearly indicates when changes will take effect |

## Exit Points

Users exit this flow when:
- Navigating to another section of the application
- Initiating a restore operation
- Closing the application
- Completing a specific backup management task

## Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario | Trigger | System Response | User Recovery Action |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Backup Failure | Network disconnection, permissions issue, etc. | Clear error message with specific cause and troubleshooting steps | Follow guided steps to resolve connection/permission issues |
| Configuration Error | Invalid settings combination | Validation error with explanation | Correct the invalid settings based on guidance |
| Repository Unavailable | Repository offline or inaccessible | Alert with repository status and reconnection options | Check repository connection or select alternative repository |
| Insufficient Storage | Not enough space for backup | Warning before backup starts with space requirements | Free up space or change repository location |
| Backup Conflict | Multiple backups attempting to run simultaneously | Notification with conflict resolution options | Choose which backup should proceed or reschedule |
