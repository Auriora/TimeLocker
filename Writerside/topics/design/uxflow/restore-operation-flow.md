# Restore Operation Flow

This document details the Restore Operation Flow for the TimeLocker application, which enables users to recover files from their backups.

## Flow Objective

The Restore Operation Flow aims to:
- Provide a clear and stress-free process for file recovery
- Enable users to easily locate specific files across backup snapshots
- Allow preview of files before restoration
- Offer flexible restore options (location, conflict resolution)
- Provide transparent progress and status information

## Entry Points

Users enter this flow when:
- Selecting "Restore Files" from the dashboard
- Clicking a "Restore" button in the backup detail panel
- Responding to a system notification suggesting restoration
- Using the application's search function to find files to restore

## Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor | Action | System Response | UI Elements | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | User | Selects "Restore Files" from dashboard | System opens restore interface | Restore interface with timeline | Visual timeline shows available backup points |
| 2 | User | Selects a backup point | System loads snapshot contents | File browser with search capability | Allows filtering by file type, date, etc. |
| 3 | User | Navigates to and selects files/folders | System highlights selections | Selection indicators, file preview | Preview available for common file types |
| 4 | User | Selects "Restore Selected" | System prompts for restore location | Location selector with smart defaults | Offers original location or custom destination |
| 5 | User | Confirms restore location | System initiates restore operation | Progress indicator with cancel option | Shows estimated time remaining |
| 6 | System | Completes restore | System notifies user of completion | Success notification with details | Option to open restored files |

## Exit Points

Users exit this flow when:
- Completing a successful restore operation
- Canceling the restore process
- Navigating away from the restore interface
- Closing the application during restore (operation continues in background)

## Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario | Trigger | System Response | User Recovery Action |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Snapshot Access Failure | Repository connection issue | Error message with connection troubleshooting | Check repository connection and retry |
| Destination Write Error | Insufficient permissions or disk space | Specific error with cause and alternatives | Choose different destination or free up space |
| File Conflict | Files exist at restore destination | Prompt with options (skip, overwrite, keep both) | Select preferred conflict resolution option |
| Corrupted File | File integrity issue in backup | Warning with file details and recovery options | Skip file or attempt repair options |
| Restore Interruption | Network disconnection or system shutdown | Automatic resume option on next connection | Resume interrupted restore operation |
