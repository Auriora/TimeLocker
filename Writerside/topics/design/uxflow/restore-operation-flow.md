## Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor  | Action                                 | System Response                     | UI Elements                           | Notes                                          |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User   | Selects "Restore Files" from dashboard | System opens restore interface      | Restore interface with timeline       | Visual timeline shows available backup points  |
| 2      | User   | Selects a backup point                 | System loads snapshot contents      | File browser with search capability   | Allows filtering by file type, date, etc.      |
| 3      | User   | Navigates to and selects files/folders | System highlights selections        | Selection indicators, file preview    | Preview available for common file types        |
| 4      | User   | Selects "Restore Selected"             | System prompts for restore location | Location selector with smart defaults | Offers original location or custom destination |
| 5      | User   | Confirms restore location              | System initiates restore operation  | Progress indicator with cancel option | Shows estimated time remaining                 |
| 6      | System | Completes restore                      | System notifies user of completion  | Success notification with details     | Option to open restored files                  |

## Exit Points

Users exit this flow when:

- Completing a successful restore operation
- Canceling the restore process
- Navigating away from the restore interface
- Closing the application during restore (operation continues in background)

## Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario          | Trigger                                  | System Response                                  | User Recovery Action                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Snapshot Access Failure | Repository connection issue              | Error message with connection troubleshooting    | Check repository connection and retry         |
| Destination Write Error | Insufficient permissions or disk space   | Specific error with cause and alternatives       | Choose different destination or free up space |
| File Conflict           | Files exist at restore destination       | Prompt with options (skip, overwrite, keep both) | Select preferred conflict resolution option   |

## Design Considerations

### For Everyday Users (Sarah)

- Simplified timeline with clear date/time labels
- Familiar file browser interface similar to system file explorer
- Prominent file preview to confirm correct selection
- Guided conflict resolution with plain-language options
- One-click restore to original locations

### For Power Users (Michael)

- Detailed snapshot metadata and comparison tools
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Batch restore operations with custom parameters
- Command-line equivalent actions shown for learning
- Performance metrics during restore operations

### For Business Users (Elena)

- Priority indicators for business-critical files
- Compliance information for regulated data
- Batch restore presets for common business scenarios
- Delegation options for team-managed restores
- Audit trail of restore operations

## Accessibility Considerations

- File browser supports keyboard navigation and selection
- Preview panel includes alternative text descriptions for non-text files
- Progress indicators include both visual and numerical representations
- Color-coded status indicators also use distinct shapes and icons
- All text elements support screen readers with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Restore options include large touch targets for users with motor limitations

## Performance Expectations

- Snapshot list should load within 3 seconds
- File browser should respond to navigation within 500ms
- File preview should load within 2 seconds for common file types
- Search results should appear within 1 second for typical repositories
- Restore operations should provide progress updates at least once per second
- Large file restores should support background operation with notifications

- [Repository Management Flow](repository-management-flow.md) - For managing repository access
- [Log Analysis Flow](log-analysis-flow.md) - For reviewing restore operation history

## Notes

- The restore interface prioritizes clarity and confidence during what can be a stressful operation for users
- File preview functionality depends on file type and size (some files may not be previewable)
- Conflict resolution options are presented before restore begins to avoid interruptions
- Restore operations can be paused and resumed if needed
- Successful restores are logged for audit and reference purposes
