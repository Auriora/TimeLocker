# Accessibility & Performance

This document details the accessibility considerations and performance expectations for the TimeLocker application, ensuring it is usable by all users and performs efficiently across different environments.

## Accessibility Considerations

TimeLocker is designed to be accessible to users with diverse abilities, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standards.

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Complete Keyboard Access**: All functionality is available without requiring a mouse
- **Logical Tab Order**: Navigation follows a natural and predictable sequence
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus state for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Customizable shortcuts for common operations
- **No Keyboard Traps**: Users can navigate to and from all components

### Screen Reader Compatibility

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **ARIA Attributes**: Appropriate use of ARIA roles, states, and properties
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive text for all non-text content
- **Form Labels**: All form controls have associated labels
- **Meaningful Sequence**: Content is presented in a logical reading order
- **Status Updates**: Screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes

### Visual Design

- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Color Independence**: Information is not conveyed by color alone
- **Text Resizing**: Interface remains functional when text is enlarged up to 200%
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different viewport sizes and zoom levels
- **Consistent Navigation**: Predictable placement of navigation elements
- **Error Identification**: Errors are clearly identified and described

### Input Methods

- **Touch Target Size**: Interactive elements have adequate size for touch input
- **Input Flexibility**: Support for various input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, voice)
- **Error Prevention**: Confirmation for actions with significant consequences
- **Input Assistance**: Labels, instructions, and error suggestions
- **Gesture Alternatives**: All gesture-based interactions have non-gesture alternatives

### Cognitive Considerations

- **Simple Language**: Clear, concise text with minimal technical jargon
- **Consistent Patterns**: Predictable behaviors and interface patterns
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback on operation progress
- **Timeout Warnings**: Notification before session timeouts with option to extend
- **Reduced Motion**: Option to minimize or eliminate animations
- **Error Recovery**: Clear guidance for resolving errors

## Performance Expectations

TimeLocker is designed to perform efficiently across different devices and network conditions.

### Response Times

| Operation | Target Response Time | Maximum Acceptable Time |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Initial application launch | < 3 seconds | 5 seconds |
| Dashboard loading | < 2 seconds | 3 seconds |
| Status information refresh | < 1 second | 2 seconds |
| File browsing navigation | < 500ms | 1 second |
| Backup operation start | < 3 seconds | 5 seconds |
| Restore operation start | < 3 seconds | 5 seconds |
| Settings application | < 1 second | 2 seconds |
| Search results | < 2 seconds | 4 seconds |

### Resource Utilization

- **CPU Usage**: 
  - Idle: < 1% of system CPU
  - Active backup: < 30% of system CPU
  - Background operation: < 10% of system CPU

- **Memory Usage**:
  - Base application: < 200MB
  - During backup operations: < 500MB
  - Large restore operations: < 1GB

- **Disk I/O**:
  - Prioritized to minimize impact on other applications
  - Configurable I/O limits to prevent system slowdown
  - Efficient caching to reduce redundant operations

- **Network Usage**:
  - Bandwidth throttling options for remote repositories
  - Resumable transfers for interrupted operations
  - Compression to reduce data transfer volume

### Scalability

- **Repository Size**: Efficiently handles repositories up to 10TB
- **File Count**: Manages backups with up to 10 million files
- **Concurrent Operations**: Supports multiple simultaneous operations
- **User Interface**: Remains responsive with large data sets through virtualization

### Offline Capability

- **Offline Mode**: Core functionality available without internet connection
- **Sync Mechanism**: Automatic synchronization when connection is restored
- **Local Caching**: Essential data cached for offline access
- **Operation Queueing**: Tasks queued when resources unavailable

### Background Processing

- **Background Operations**: Long-running tasks continue in background
- **System Tray Integration**: Status visible when application is minimized
- **Notification System**: Alerts for completed operations
- **Low Priority Mode**: Reduced resource usage during user activity

## Testing & Validation

### Accessibility Testing

- **Automated Testing**: Regular automated accessibility scans
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Verification with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- **Keyboard-Only Testing**: Complete functionality testing without mouse
- **Color Contrast Analysis**: Verification of all color combinations
- **User Testing**: Testing with users having diverse abilities

### Performance Testing

- **Load Testing**: Verification under various load conditions
- **Stress Testing**: Behavior under extreme conditions
- **Endurance Testing**: Performance over extended periods
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage tracking
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Performance across supported operating systems

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes when needed
- Ensure keyboard event handlers for all interactive elements
- Follow performance budgets for each component
- Implement lazy loading for resource-intensive components
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

### For Designers

- Design with sufficient color contrast
- Create focus states for all interactive elements
- Provide text alternatives for all visual elements
- Design responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Consider reduced motion alternatives for animations
- Use clear, consistent iconography with labels
- Design for progressive enhancement

## Monitoring & Improvement

- **Accessibility Audits**: Regular reviews against WCAG guidelines
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ongoing tracking of application performance
- **User Feedback**: Channels for accessibility and performance feedback
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates based on findings and feedback
