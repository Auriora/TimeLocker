# 1  Introduction

The **Desktop Backup Application (DBA)** is a software solution designed to provide users with a seamless, intuitive, and secure way to manage their backups. Initially targeting Linux desktop environments, with future support planned for Windows and macOS, the DBA enhances the functionality of the open-source **Restic CLI** by offering a graphical interface coupled with advanced features such as scheduling, policy enforcement, and reporting. This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the application to ensure clarity and alignment amongst development, quality assurance, project management, and stakeholder teams.

The primary objective of the DBA is to simplify the process of configuring, executing, monitoring, and restoring file-system backups while addressing modern-day requirements such as data encryption, GDPR compliance, and usability standards. It is built to serve both everyday users seeking simplicity and power users/system administrators requiring advanced configuration and automation capabilities. This document serves as a comprehensive reference for stakeholders involved in the application’s development and lifecycle.
