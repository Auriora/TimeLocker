# Bug Triage and Management

Bug management involves identifying, categorizing, prioritizing, and tracking software defects. For solo developers, an efficient process helps maintain quality without becoming overwhelmed.

## Why It Matters

For solo developers, effective bug management:
- Helps you focus on the most important issues first
- Prevents critical bugs from slipping through the cracks
- Provides transparency to stakeholders about known issues
- Reduces mental load by externalizing bug tracking
- Improves planning and estimation for fixes

## Simple Bug Management Process

### 1. Capture Bugs Effectively

- Use a consistent format for all bug reports
- Include clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Document expected vs. actual behavior
- Add screenshots or videos when relevant
- Note environment details (OS, browser, version)

### 2. Classify and Prioritize

**Severity levels:**
- **Critical**: Crashes, data loss, security issues
- **Major**: Significant limitations with workarounds
- **Minor**: Non-essential or cosmetic issues

**Priority factors:**
- Business impact and user visibility
- Fix complexity and risk
- Frequency of occurrence
- Dependencies with other issues

### 3. Track and Resolve

- Use a simple tool (GitHub Issues, Trello, spreadsheet)
- Track status (New → In Progress → Fixed → Verified)
- Write regression tests for fixed bugs
- Document root causes for future learning

## Bug Report Template

```markdown
# Bug: [Brief Description]

## Severity: [Critical/Major/Minor]
## Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]

## Expected vs. Actual
- Expected: [What should happen]
- Actual: [What actually happens]

## Environment
- [OS/Browser/Version info]

## Evidence
[Screenshots or logs]
```

## Effective Bug Management Strategies

### The "Zero Bug Policy"

- Fix bugs before adding new features
- Immediately triage new bugs
- Either fix soon or explicitly decide not to fix
- Avoid accumulating bug debt

### The "Bug Budget" Alternative

- Set a maximum number of open bugs (e.g., 10-20)
- When you hit your limit, fix a bug before adding features
- Regularly review and close bugs you'll never fix
- Prioritize ruthlessly

## Weekly Bug Review (Even With Yourself)

Schedule 15-30 minutes weekly to:
- Review and classify new bugs
- Decide which bugs to fix this week
- Close or defer low-priority bugs
- Look for patterns that indicate deeper issues

## Common Pitfalls

- **Not tracking minor bugs**: They accumulate and become overwhelming
- **Perfectionism**: Not every bug needs fixing
- **Poor reproduction steps**: Always verify you can reproduce before fixing
- **Missing regression tests**: Write tests to prevent bugs from returning
- **Inconsistent prioritization**: Establish clear criteria and stick to them

## Practical Tips

- Schedule dedicated bug-fixing time blocks
- Group similar bugs to fix them efficiently
- Learn from bug patterns to improve your code
- Be transparent with stakeholders about bug status
- Use bugs as opportunities to improve your development process
