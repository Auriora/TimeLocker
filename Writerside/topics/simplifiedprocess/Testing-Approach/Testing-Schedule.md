# Testing Schedule

A testing schedule defines when different types of testing should occur throughout development. An effective schedule ensures quality without overwhelming your limited time.

## Why It Matters

For solo developers, a well-planned testing schedule:
- Distributes testing throughout development, preventing last-minute rushes
- Catches issues early when they're easier to fix
- Helps allocate limited time effectively
- Builds confidence incrementally
- Reduces stress by eliminating pre-release testing pressure

## Key Testing Phases

### 1. During Development (Daily)

- Write unit tests alongside new code
- Run fast-executing tests frequently
- Test edge cases as you implement them
- Make testing part of your daily routine

### 2. After Feature Completion

- Run integration tests for the feature
- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Verify interactions with existing functionality
- Conduct exploratory testing to find unexpected issues

### 3. Before Releases

- Run regression tests to verify existing functionality
- Test critical workflows end-to-end
- Verify all fixed bugs remain fixed
- Test installation/upgrade processes

### 4. At Regular Intervals

- Security vulnerability scanning (monthly)
- Performance testing (monthly)
- Accessibility testing (quarterly)
- Technical debt assessment (quarterly)

## Simple Testing Templates

### Daily Testing Routine

```
Morning (15 min):
- Run unit tests for recent code
- Fix any failing tests

During Development:
- Write tests alongside code
- Test after completing each function

End of Day (15 min):
- Ensure all tests pass
- Commit tests with code
```

### Pre-Release Checklist

```
1. Run all automated tests
2. Test critical user workflows manually
3. Verify fixed bugs remain fixed
4. Check performance of key operations
5. Run security scan
6. Test on all supported platforms
7. Verify documentation accuracy
```

## Recommended Testing Frequencies

| Testing Type | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Unit | Daily (with development) |
| Integration | Weekly |
| Functional | After each feature |
| UI | Bi-weekly (critical flows) |
| Performance | Monthly |
| Security | Monthly |
| Regression | Before each release |

## Practical Tips

- Block dedicated testing time in your calendar
- Automate the most frequently run tests
- Use checklists to ensure consistency
- Combine multiple testing types in one session
- Adjust testing effort based on risk
- Treat testing as non-negotiable, even when busy
- Be realistic about time constraints
- Focus on high-value testing activities first
