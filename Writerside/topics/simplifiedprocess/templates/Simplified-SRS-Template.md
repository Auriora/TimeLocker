# SRS Reference

This document now serves as a reference to the comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documentation available in the Writerside docs/SDLC/SRS.

## Comprehensive SRS Documentation

The complete SRS documentation is available in the Writerside docs/SDLC/SRS directory. This documentation provides a comprehensive approach to requirements specification, including:

- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- Use cases and user stories
- Data models and external interfaces
- Compliance mappings for standards like GDPR, ASVS, and WCAG

## Key Sections in the SRS Documentation

The SRS documentation is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Introduction**: Purpose, scope, references, and overview
2. **Overall Description**: Product perspective, functions, user characteristics, constraints, and assumptions
3. **Specific Requirements**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Use Cases**: Detailed use cases for the system
5. **Compliance & Traceability**: Mappings to various standards and regulations
6. **Appendices**: Glossary, analysis models, and other supporting information
7. **Document Change Management**: History of changes to the document

## AI Assistance Prompts for SRS Development

Use these prompts with your AI assistant to help develop and refine your SRS:

- "Based on the project description, what functional requirements should I include?"
- "What non-functional requirements are critical for this type of application?"
- "Help me prioritize these requirements using the MoSCoW method."
- "What use cases should I document for this feature?"
- "What data entities and attributes should be included in the data model?"
- "What external interfaces should I consider for this system?"
- "Are there any requirements I've overlooked for this type of application?"
- "Help me identify potential conflicts or dependencies between these requirements."
- "What acceptance criteria should I include for this requirement?"
- "How can I make this requirement more specific and measurable?"

## Notes for Solo Development

- Focus on requirements that provide the most value first
- Use AI to help identify edge cases and potential issues
- Revisit and update the SRS as development progresses
- Document assumptions clearly as they often become requirements
- For solo projects, it's acceptable to combine or simplify sections as needed
- Use the SRS as a living document that evolves with the project
