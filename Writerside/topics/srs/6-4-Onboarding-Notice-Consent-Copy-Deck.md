| **Dialog Title**               | **Welcome to Desktop Backup Application**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Intro Paragraph**            | "We respect your privacy and the security of your files. Before you start using Desktop Backup Application, please review how we handle your information and choose the settings that are right for you."                                                                                                        |
| **Why We Need Your Data**      | "The app stores a small amount of personal data *locally*—such as the list of backup repositories, encryption keys (securely in your operating-system key-ring), scheduling preferences, and an audit log of actions you perform. This data never leaves your computer unless you configure a cloud repository." |
| **What We Never Collect**      | "We do **not** collect telemetry, usage analytics, or any contents of your files. Your backups remain fully encrypted with a key that only you control."                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Checkbox 1**                 | **[ ] I understand that my backup repositories may reside outside the EEA/UK and I accept responsibility for selecting a compliant region.**                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Checkbox 2**                 | **[ ] I consent to the Desktop Backup Application storing my repository configuration and audit log on this device.** *(Required to continue)*                                                                                                                                                                   |
