# 6.7 Requirements Prioritization Matrix

This document provides a prioritization framework for the TimeLocker project requirements, helping to make informed decisions about what to implement and in what order.

## How to Use This Matrix

1. **List all requirements** in the table below, using their unique IDs
2. **Assign a MoSCoW priority** to each requirement:
   - **Must Have**: Critical requirements without which the system will not function
   - **Should Have**: Important requirements that should be included if possible
   - **Could Have**: Desirable requirements that can be omitted if necessary
   - **Won't Have**: Requirements that will not be implemented in the current version
3. **Rate the complexity** of implementing each requirement on a scale of 1-5
4. **Rate the value** of each requirement on a scale of 1-5
5. **Calculate the Value/Complexity Ratio**
6. **Determine the implementation order** based on priority, value/complexity ratio, and dependencies
7. **Document your rationale** for prioritization decisions

## Prioritization Strategies

The following strategies were used when prioritizing requirements:

1. **Core functionality first**: Requirements essential for the system to function (repository management, basic backup operations) are prioritized highest
2. **Value-driven prioritization**: High-value items with relatively low complexity are prioritized higher
3. **Dependency-based prioritization**: Requirements with dependencies are scheduled after their prerequisites
4. **Compliance requirements**: GDPR and security-related requirements are given high priority

## Implementation Plan

Based on the prioritization matrix, the implementation plan is as follows:

1. Implement core repository management functionality (FR-RM-001, FR-RM-003)
2. Implement basic backup operations (FR-BK-001)
3. Implement data integrity features (FR-BK-004, FR-RM-005)
4. Implement compliance features (FR-RM-004, NFR-AUD-01)
5. Implement advanced backup features (FR-BK-002, FR-RM-002, FR-BK-003)
6. Implement performance requirements (NFR-PERF-01, NFR-PERF-02, NFR-PERF-03)
7. Implement resource management and additional features (NFR-PERF-04, NFR-AUD-02, FR-BK-005)

This plan ensures that the most critical functionality is implemented first, while considering dependencies and maximizing value delivery.
